Spicy ninja roll is the only reason why I keep coming here . The happy hour pricing and the lunch portions and pricing are a bargain . Service sometimes lacks but the food is good
Due to majorcontruction could not get any information or a tour . The building site looks great and currents reside traceaboutgneace
Great for greasy late night eats . You can ' t go wrong with a burger and a side of fries or fried pickles .
Girls were pretty . Food was good . Nothing special . Had the original wings and fried pickles .
Download the free app " Skate Universe " to earn up to 1000 free tickets sent instantly to your email . Its works , and its much faster to get then playing games lol
Um it ' s pretty average ramen . . . Don ' t see what ' s the hype at all . Will not be back again .
Double Check your order , usually correct but have had to take in a few items . Not Bad and Super close
Great atmosphere . The food is mediocre . Not bad . But there ' s other places out there better .
Menu on website says they have cold brew , but it ' s just regular iced coffee - misleading .
Here for the Arsenal Challenge tournament . Nice enough facility but mosquitoes are out in full force . Has playground for kids and a small pond . Decent soccer fields and good baseball diamonds .
Great food but don ' t go if you ate in a hurry . I was in the drive thru for 20 minutes with 1 person in front of me .
Service was ok . The place was clean . We ordered each item off the dim sum menu and honestly , the only thing I really like was the soup dumpling .
The Spring Rolls and Pinneapple Curry were very good , but I just wasn ' t impressed with the atmosphere or service .
Good ice cream put poor systems . One cashier for busy night with a line to pay 20 deep . . .
Not really any different than most gelato places . It ' s just an Italian place in Greektown . Perhaps that ' s why it ' s attracting so many locals .
My half tried their mahi - mahi , it wasn ' t to his appeal . The jerk chicken is so good .
Pretty good fast Asian food . Nice service . And they got brown rice , so it works for me !
Good food quality , quick pick - up turnarounds and very reasonable pricing makes Orient House ideal for when you ' ve got a hankering and don ' t have a lot of time for lunch .
Small place great food but slow service . When they say 15 min wait expect 45 min wait .
This place is okay . . . nothing really special . They do have some great vegetarian dishes . . but they also serve fish . . BOOO ! ! ! !
Good service , liked their seafood platter , and the ambiance was nice . I ' d probably go back again if I were staying at the Venetian .
Nice little place with an outdoor patio . Mosquitoes like to gather when it gets dark . It ' s a great place for cocktails and lite fair . Servers could have been a little more attentive .
Usually I write more , but just this : there are better places around , as well as better in good and better in prices . It ' s a bar and not a restaurant in my opinion
Expensive , but groceries are fresh and really the 3 stars is for the 24 hour service . If they were cheaper , they ' d get four stars .
Decent water park if you do not spend full price for admission . Limited rides & no lazy river . Other than that it was a great place to spend an afternoon !
In - n - out ＞＞＞ Smashburger ＞ Fatburger ' nuff said
Very good yogurts . . . Would not consider this a Golden Spoon level of goodness , but definitely would go back . I had the Giradelli Chocolate and Cheese cake mixed .
The straight Mac n cheese is way too dry and plain for my expectation of gourmet Mac n cheese . Otherwise great service for a food truck !
I got chicken Pad Thai and asked for it mildly spicy . I should have asked for medium spice because it came out pink and tasted sweet . The Thai iced tea was good though !
These donuts are great but hot light ends at 9 not 10 . Even message says 5pm to 10pm . . . wth guys ?
Came here one night and the crepe was very good . . came for breakfast 2 days later and the latte tasted like sewer while the crepe was extra dry . .
Prices are a little steep
I like this place . It ' s relatively new and clean . In in a really good location on the bashas parking lot .
Ride the Mechanical bull I dare you , I had a goodtime
I ' ve been here 2x wasn ' t impressed the first time figured give them a second try . There latte doesn ' t impress me I ' d rather goto the Starbucks adjacent to this spot
Beau café bien aménagé . Bons produits . Cependant il est souvent bondé . De plus leur wifi fonctionne très mal depuis longtemps et malgré les plaintes il font rien pour remédier à la situation .
Went back . . . staff was more friendly and I was able to purchase something fun . Kierland is an awesome outdoor place to shop ! Will be back next vacation to see what they have .
Good food , great staff , and good coffee . We went on Sunday and it was full . Had to wait for a table but it was worth it . Mediterranean Omelet was excellent .
Good taco shop with flavorful food ; everyone enjoyed their lunch .
Usually a great place to grab a quick bite . Today was not that day . Watering down the salad dressing ? Come on !
Outback does a great job as a chain of restaurants . This one seem to have it right .
had their cheese plate , and 2 pasta dishes . Pasta was very well prepared , texture was awesome . I find this place a bit over priced , but it makes sense given the area .
They have Happy Hour from 4 : 30 - 6 and this is the time I would go . Their sushi was okay , nothing spectacular . No liquor license yet either .
I want to love Mojo , special location , great feel , looks great . Good service but . . . . Coffee sucks , your a morning joint you need great coffee Please please try another brew
Plastic table cloths , homey feeling - it ' s like a dinner from the 80 ' s . It ' s cheap and cheerful food in my opinion . Not amazing but pretty good .
Drinks are 10 USD each which seems pricey for the run - down area . Still , its a fairly nice lounge on weekends .
New to the area and had a papa johns in so - cal I loved . This place is decent if you want chain pizza at a good price .
Decent flavour , similar to osmows chicken on the rocks but nowhere near as flavourful . Portion size is fair . Food was a bit cold . Good service .
Its good enough for me for last minute nibble . Many tables , smile service . Many choices . Fast .
Had an issue . . finally got it resolved after a couple weeks . Thanks
What stood out to me most was the lovely staff . The food is pretty good , but not mind - blowing . I ' d still go back though .
Its okay , def doesnt stand out . Just a typical diner with decent food . Not bad but def not the best .
So so dessert but very expensive for what it is . The wait time is also not great . At least the service we got was good . . .
Fancy overpriced sushi . I felt rushed the entire evening by our server . What kind of restaurant tells their patrons they only have a table for a brief period of time .
A very decent brunch option where you can get a seat and is family friendly . A much better option than lining up for he place up the road .
I heard this is one of the places you need to go in Toronto but to be honest there are so many better restaurant to go . Food does not meet expectations at all .
Service was bad . Our server didn ' t come back and refill our water , ask if we wanted boxes and they also ran out of udon and green tea mochi .
Dry cleaning - fine ( sweaters , shirts ) . Alterations - DON ' T WASTE YOUR MONEY .
Just OK a little disappointed . . I was alone and felt that I was rushed and ignored .
Was there for Fromage D ' ici , how do you rate a shopping mall if you ain ' t a mallrat ?
Its cool . . 24hr drive - thru tho lol
New Management . New Name . It ' s now Mr . Pho .
Ahh ok not great stuff for fat guys but wives will love it
Decent Thai food , but not remarkable . Would probably come here again , but I definitely prefer the Spice Island Tea House in Oakland .
The fly swatting by the guy behind the counter threw me off a little but good http .
This food was delicious ! Beautiful presentation too . Took slightly over an hour for them to run cards .
A neighborhood sports bar serving pub fare with some occasional interesting twists . Friendly , timely service . Limited bar . Food is well prepared with generous portions .
Big points for the view and ambience . Great place to have a drink and look at the city lights . Bread pudding is really good . Otherwise food is average .
He was reasonably priced when we needed a new water heater and came out right away . No issues .
Pretty nice bar . Their drinks are overpriced , but they ' re located in the heart of the Waterfront .
Cafe princess needs an update . The couches are getting dirty ! Food and drinks are not bad - worth a try
Beef carpacio is good , pizza is fresh . Good , over priced Italian food at best . However , great patio for drinks located on a surprisingly quiet street .
Food isn ' t bad but it ' s overrated . Service can be curt at times . It can get crowded quite easily and the parking situation is terrible .
A decent spot but service needs some work . Good food in a pinch .
this place is great . . . the steak was amazing and that seafood platter we had was slamming .
Stopped by for dessert based on reviews . Cute little place . We ordered a small hot fudge sundae and a small pineapple sundae . Both were very good and service was very quick .
Okay food . Pleasant service . One of the better establishments in Euclid .
Food is tasty . Sitting environment is okay . Service is down right terrible . Will seriously think twice before returning .
I was looking for a fresh clean taste . Most of their dishes are fried with heavy creamy sauce .
It ' s ok . Overrated . Nothing special . Burgers were average . I prefer this place over the chains .
I usually love the sandwiches here but this evening , both our sandwiches were very dry . BEWARE and do not go to this location Saturday evenings
Pimento fritters were really good . I don ' t recall what our meal was , but I remember it was decent . Want to give this place another try .
Great food but the wait is a bit much and when I got my food the eggs that said they were poached were hard boiled . But other than that the eggs Benedetto was fantastic .
Big meat portions . Tiziki sauce with the fresh pita is yummy . Really nice employees . Fries are good .
Quite delicious but desserts are advertised as $ 4 on menu outside , $ 5 on the wall but are actually $ 6 on the menu inside ( and your bill ) .
Food was good but service was slow . We went in for a quick lunch and was there for an hour and 15 minutes . I would go back but not when time is an issue .
Great location on the strip but the food & service needs improvement . Wait a very long time to someone to take our order . The queso was a disappointment : (
Place is ok . Came in a few times . Wings are good . Not really a fan of the sandwiches or burgers . Beer is always cold . Bartenders are always friendly .
Food was decent . The filet was cooked correctly but seemeda little salty . Sides and veggies were good . Service was average at best . For the price range of this restaurant I expected better .
Tasty dim sum overall . The only issue is that service can be quite slow , even compared to other Chinese establishments . Come here early in the day . . line up can be long .
My French toast and eggs were good , but the plastic plates and silverware get poor marks for sustainability .
The action is near the bar . For - two seating is bland , lacks creativity , had sharp bright spot lighting , and is too cramped for intimacy .
The bone broth and the spicy one were flavorless . I did enjoy the selection of foods . They had snow crab , small whole crabs , lamb , ice cream , and various desserts .
Food is alright , prices are cheap . Service isnt the best , they dont really pay attention Food takes forever to get to the table
It ' s a pretty good radio station if your a younger person they need to play a wide range of music for the young and old .
Its ok . Nothing really stands out . Paninis is a good place to grab a sandwich but thats really about it .
Yakitori is really good here , the miso is soso , and the rest looked good , but i don ' t like sushi . . the staff is really nice and all in all a fun place .
service may not be their strongest point but their sushi is good . They have great lunch specials and Happy Hour specials !
I was there Saturday evening . The staff and atmosphere was great . But the jerk chicken was merely seasoned baked chicken and my coconut shrimp was fried in old oil .
The pho here wasn ' t as good as Saigon Bay although I like that you can customize your pho bowl .
Solid diner food . Nothing special . Old - time , regional decor with a juke box in the corner . A local favorite for all the right and wrong reasons . Definitely a neighborhood joint .
Quick place for an inexpensive , not high quality , meal . Good for kids , great milkshakes .
If your going to bevegan why not offer gluten free bread ?
Really enjoyed the food , but i didnt get full and it was kinda pricey . . It ' s a fun enviornment with lots off friendly people . Will go again but just not even im really hungry
One of the authentic Italian places I have visited . I would say food wasn ' t that great , but overall left happy from here . Joe ' s shrimp pasta was good .
Been in a couple of times . Breakfast is fantastic ! Can ' t beat their smoked dishes . At night , the ladies working seem to want to be there but overall not that welcoming
meh . maybe i got the wrong thing . Everyone loves this place so ignore this review haha
Good food , great service . Downside is it ' s extremely greasy . Other than that , it ' s a great place .
Nothin special , just a good ol ' fashioned Chinese buffet at a decent price .
Clean . Never super busy so get what I need without a hassle . Workers are always friendly and smiling . Bathrooms suck though . Wouldn ' t recommend the hot dogs either . Super oily and gross
Remember you are in an airport . That said it has reasonable pricing and good size portions . Very good beer . Garlic fries help the beer go down so beer careful .
Great pick for some Mexican after late - night Vegas - ing . Not fancy like Border Grill , but that ' s not its purpose - just great , cheesy grub right before your nap .
It ' s very cheap on your pockets and very good to your eyes and fare on taste . It beats the other places . I will return .
Food was good but not great . I would give them another chance . Interior decor was nice and homey .
This is no longer Guardian who was bought out by Safelight and this location has been closed .
Just ok . I had the street padthai . It looks totally different from the picture . Giving it a three star considering the price .
Wanna be margaritaville . Served small potions and the food came out cold . Did comp the cold meal so that was nice of them .
was super fun , wayyy to busy ! ! ! And no payouts . . . . blahhhh
The flavors are pretty good , but the sandwiches are so small for their price . And the place feels a bit stuffy , could use a fan or something .
Food is ok , service is hit or miss ! Beef jerky us my favorite dish . Thai tea is not my favorite
Meh . . . OK food . OK wine . OK service .
Decent burgers , but their fries are the winner here ! ! ! Really good , crispy , and a pinch of salt . Good service , good portion size and casual ambiance .
Great selection of beers and fantastic cocktails ! This place has a hip atmosphere in a great lounge style . Worth a stop for some drinks and socializing .
I appreciate Sam & Jerry . They made my moving much easier . They assembled my bed and moved all even very little stuff .
Great food ! Mediocre service . . . . Pricing and quality of food was excellent . . Server was not attentive . . We received more attention from the manager / owner our server .
Located outside of Las Vegas , this old western town features a chapel , saloon , petting zoo and shooting gallery . It ' s a fun time .
It ' s an okay place - I don ' t mind coming here for a drink or two - but that ' s about it .
Not impressed with the food here . Nothing spectacular about this place . Steak was not prepared to tempature and service is medicore at best . . . . Tried it twice but not super impressed both time .
Good place and a nice atmosphere . I like the island vibe and the cool turtle painting . Food is pretty good . : )
Had Pho here for the first time . Its pretty decent but nothing to get super excited about . The place was nice , service was good and it was not expensive .
Place wasn ' t too busy and food was prepared relatively quickly . I had the spicy pad Thai which was Alright but nothing spectacular . I will be back to try their other dishes
The food were good but the portion seems to be getting smaller and smaller . We waited about 30 mins for our foods , service is average .
Left without ordering . Takes way too long when the barista is taking his time . Don ' t come here if you ' re in a hurry or trying to get coffee in a timely manner
Sushi was great , Chinese okay , not fantastic but not bad either . Prices high . . . more expensive than NY for just okay food . . .
Loved the ambiance , attentive wait staff . Burgers were delish ! I prefer my pommes frites to be crispy , light ; mine were limp and heavy . Wine was exceptional .
Really enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would . The drinks were on the pricey side , but I didn ' t head here to get smashed .
This place has great service but the food was only mediocre and definitely didn ' t warrant the price . Stars are for the service , probably could have gotten better Asian food at Panda Express .
Everything you need for crafts , but be prepared for a 30 minute wait to check out . . .
I really like the location and the atmosphere . But I didn ' t really care for the food . I wasn ' t feeling the Thai flavors .
Service was great , but the vermicelli and drink lacked flavor . The pho base seemed to be very good .
Really good at delivering a caribbean flare to food in a city that is far from caribbean ! Unfortunately the drinks are not so spectacular and the decorations are borderline cheesy .
Food was just okay , Wasn ' t anything special . Service was really good . But for the price I expected more .
Korean BBQ as it is back in Hawaii . It ' s as simple as that . Good choices and good tasting meals .
Ok place . Food was nothing special - the calamari tasted like straight up oil . Food portions are really big which is a plus . The drinks are good service was good !
If you have a sweet tooth this is the place for you . But eat it outside because they need to kick on the air . It was hot in there .
Good value tasty dumplings .
Your basic fried stuff and burgers . Not bad , not good . Kinda pricey for what you get .
Did a family style dinner for a wedding rehearsal . Not well designed but had a good time . Wait staff seemed a bit over whelmed . Will need to try a regular dinner to judge better .
Loud and decent bar . A diversity of young and old come to this bar . A neighborhood spot for those local and in search of a little less in the club district .
We went to Pole Position as part of a team building event with work . It was pretty fun ! Definitely a great place to bring out the competitive attitude in everyone !
The sandwich was light on the meat , but still tasted good . The French fries were really tasty . Nice and crispy .
Excellent arrêt pour un fish & chip délicieux .
Especially since there are SO many famous chef restaurants in this town , average is simply not good enough here , very disappointed .
@ 2 am was told cannot take orders system rebooting ? On 4 / 30 ; sign says open 24 hours boo
The chorizo sausage is very good . The sauce is a little too sweet for me though . The chilli cheese fries are the bomb
Great Food and concept . Service was completely lacking .
Pretty Americanized environment , good service . Got the queso , grilled chicken with the Latin stir fry . Prefer " traditional " Mexican restaurants .
Cleanliest Walgreens bathroom out of all VEGAS on the strip at least .
Food is good . But 45 min for 2 tacos is ridiculous . Waited over 25 min for chips and salsa . Might try it again but not after happy hour !
Had fun at the casino . Check your bar ware . I was served wine in a dirty glass . Yuk .
Love the new chicken breakfast sandwich . Sorry I posted a pick of a mess in the back of the store , but that was not this location . It was the Ray red store in Phoenix .
the chips may well be the only thing worth going here for but the salsa , not so good perhaps the expensive booze and cheap women are a draw ?
It is what it is . In a pinch , they are better than most QST . I still love IN N OUT . . . # vino2ultimate # vinosquared
It ' s a pho restaurant but the pho ' s broth taste so dull lol . Very good and friendly customer service though .
Well as a update for 2018 I no longer take my dog here . I have found other grooming businesses that do listen to you .
The ambiance is awesome . The service was great the food and drinks not so much . Not true authentic Mexican food . It was ok however we will not be eating at this restaurant again unfortunately .
I had the lamb shank . Not a ton of meat , but it was good . Then tons of rice and salad . Filling , but not tasty .
Average diner food with average service and cramped dumpy decor . Nothing special but ok for a quick meal .
Food was just OK . Seemed like microwaved dinner . The price is OK . Just a one time visit for me
Pretty good and somewhat little known place . Food was good ! Would be cool if they could turn into a lounge / bar / setting on Friday & Saturday nights .
The selection is minimal , the sales staff was not immediately available . Overall presentation of the VW brand could be better .
The deep dish was a little disappointing maybe the thin will be my next choice . I will give them another shot .
The other location tastes better . The food we order was average at most . Maybe I came in on a off day ?
Salad was a ripoff with mostly iceberg . Pizza was good but could use more cheese . Atmosphere was nice and lively . Wait staff were nice . Service was relatively prompt .
In all accounts , everything is just fine . The best thing about this restaurant is it ' s location .
Over priced and over hyped ! Good burger and fries but In and Out is a better deal and experience overall
The food was decent . I had the BBQ Mahi Taco which I felt were too saucy . The chips were stale .
Not too bad . . . the service was friendly . The bread was nice but my beef shawarma was overcooked and very dry .
Pretty decent food . Friendliness of staff is hit or miss .
Glad that this place is here and close by to all the Brookline peeps . Small selection though . Would probably drive to a larger store to have more wine choices .
I really like Egg Works ! The muffins , the Loco Moco , corn beef hash , hash browns and pancakes are all amazing ! The service is typically shitty , but its do - able !
Out of the 4 Brazilian steakhouses is Las Vegas I would put this one in 4th place . The food is fine . The service was very good but we will not be back .
The prices are a little high and I just bought a farmer cheese pierogi and they were extremely over salted ! They used to be better when they first opened .
The sausage and cheese sandwiches were pretty good . It could be much better if the service was better .
Good food and service , but you are segregated from the bar completely . Can ' t even hear music . Minors are kicked out at 10 pm kind of dumb .
A bit pricy for what you get . The quality of food is only average . The service is great . Definitely far from authentic korean BBQ though . Overall I was disappointed .
Pretty cool and fun place to hangout ! Simple and straightforward , but an interesting concept . If * * * * buck ' s can offer flavored coffee , why not offered specialty / flavored sodas ?
Nice place to shop , they also have apple store and disney store , but you wont find luxury dept store here . But they have macy ' s . Across the parking lot . There is a cinema
Nothing special except that they do offer a chicken sandwich . The fries are horrible right out of freezer . In and Out , Smash Burger and Five Guys are much better .
Went there with a large group which they were very accommodating the pizza was good and the staff did a great job other than a bug in a water that they apologized for definitely will stop back
There was not enough seating inside for the Saturday crowds . The fries were as ordinary as you could get . The burger tasted fine , but not for the prices !
I eat at Atria ' s once a week . they have great food and drinks . in the fall I go there more often becauseof football .
Food was good , prices are decent . Had to keep tracking down the waitress to get more bread , drinks , and the bill though !
this place is not as good as the one in mesa , the food just didn ' t taste as authentic as the Mesa location
The breakfast burrito was okay and for this reason I felt it was overpriced . The location next to Ice Den and the operating hours are really great . The staff are friendly and the service was fast .
Food was decent enough . Draft beer was weak sauce . Place is smokey to the third power .
Everything was ok the only thing is the cashier she wasn ' t friendly at all . She has attitude while taking an order , and it happened twice . The drink that I got it really good
People are nice enough but not updating your website with services after 3 years is not good business practice .
Food was very good but service wss not ! My omelete was excellent ! my husband ordered chilaquiles and was also excellent !
Great place , But if you are vegan and looking for something to eat , don ' t waste your time . All fun and games , but no food for you .
The management isn ' t big on making sure the theater is glean . The only seats that were left is full of trash . Well that ' s movies today for you .
Custom burgers are delicious . Lots of choices for meat and toppings . Always a long wait so be prepared .
Overall alright . Ordered a small . Pretty heavy . Flavors were decent . Energetic employees . Could use more Flavors and serving options !
Nice selection , beans are not fried in lard . There is a nice patio when the weather is good . Margaritas are excellent .
The food are good , sushi are great , but we are not satisfy by services . We had to wait long time for next order . I think they dont have enough waitress ; )
As mentioned earlier it was quite empty . I asked it the place was opened . The food was about the same as most bars . What I really wanted to do was ride the bull .
I discovered Food Society while staying right next door at the Be SixFifty Hotel . This is a bright , airy coffee shop and a healthy alternative to Eggsmart across the street .
Dr . Kaplan is an awesome doctor he is very helpful , front staff lack on costumer service .
Ok pizzaria in Dorval if you like a wimpy pizza , their dressing is very decent and flavor wise its eatable . They also habe pretty good prices compared to others in the area .
Standard airport , nothing to write home about . Easy to navigate and the security line went pretty fast for those with TSA . It was easy to get a cab to downtown upon arrival .
Came for lunch / all you can eat for 21 . 95 . Server was unpleasant . I got 2 special rolls with shrimp tempura inside . The tempura was hard and very crunchy . Wasnt impressed .
Wish I could have added my own toppings because I felt the lady didn ' t give me enough . A little pricey but all frozen yogurt places are .
Good . Not sure about quality control on food . Great service ! Food is a bit pricey for what you get but its ok if there ' s nothing else open !
The food tastes ok but the portions are small and pricey . I would give this place another try .
Cheap food , hip atmosphere , but the sandwich ' s are just so - so . The head - cheese they include on some of the sandwiches kind of turns me off .
Ok place to grab a drink and some food which is mid grade at best . Service always good and you always get what you pay .
Atmosphere was adequate , but the food was delicious . Lemon chicken was light and crispy - - a real surprise .
Their happy hour menu has already changed . What ' s left are items that people don ' t really like . Will just come back here for the salmon donburi bowl .
The food is always fresh and tasty here . Never long wait periods once you order . The service here is always good .
they could definitely improve their internet speed . . . . it ' s sooo slow but other than that great place !
Excellent selection of beers , very spacious place and nice staff . The nachos are really tasty !
I love target but the Boca Park location is much better . Step it up Tenaya location .
Nice place , little pricey , everything is organic including the beer !
Basic american food . Let ' s say bar food done really well . Nothing that will blow your mind , but a good menu with good drinks and good service counts for something , right !
Bathrooms are a little better , I guess . A coat of paint and a new counter top have cleaned up the appearance . Signs indicate Renovations are happening . How long have those signs been up though ?
The queso bean dip here is divine !
Decent light classic lunches . Portion is at times smaller than what you ' d expect for that price . Overall a good place for a fast and convenient brunch
Friendly staff , quick service . . . but they used processed cheese in the Omelettes . : (
Wasnt bad wasnt great , service was not on point . Chairs dont have cushions . Spacious . Decor is good
Use to be my favorite buffet . New name + new Managment + ! less good food + not good service = let ' s consider somewhere else for lunch !
Nice area . . . but Mountains Edge desperately needs a dog park ! !
Cute decors . . . That ' s all Drinks and food were over priced for the quality and portion .
Food was fresh and delicious ! The staff couldn ' t have cared less about service or customers needs . Felt like we were an imposition to counter staff while trying to order . Too bad .
Decent breakfast spot with all the usual suspects . Nothing special or memorable in my book . Definitely a step above Denny ' s thougb
This place is closed and this page needs to be taken down . The new place : http : / / www . yelp . com / biz / rocky - point - cantina - tempe
Got the spicy pork bulgogi plate and was more onions than meat . Flavors weren ' t horrible , but could ' ve been better .
The plates were large portions , and the food was okay . . . . Not bad , but I ' ve also had much better Korean food . Service was great !
The food is pretty good here but the service is terrible . Sushi Legend at Leslie and finch is better = ]
Service is slow . Food is ok . Blueberry and bacon waffle is interesting . Milkshake is very good
Breakfast here with the family was pleasant . I had the fruit plate and oatmeal and my family was quite happy with their eggs in different variations . The service was really good as well .
Sadly a once glorious establishment is slowly fading into alittle more then a memory . Slowly losing the staples and watching the prices continue to go up . I loved this place now I avoid it .
All you can eat Korean BBQ for $ 10 for lunch . You can ' t beat that price . The meat itself is quite tasty and the side dishes are decent .
High quality services for the area but I have a had a few so / so experiences . Heather is great ! !
Excellent ribs ! Very good for a chain resto . Also get sweet potato fries instead of regular fries .
Not sure what all the hub up is all about . Had better burgers at five guys and in n out . Fries kinda bland . Would do 2 . 5 stars if I could
Great atmosphere , great music , open late , always seems to have people here , sushi is just average . . . Not bad not good just average .
It was great that they delivered late but I wasn ' t too impressed with any of the food or blown away .
Good but not great . Presentation needs work . Don ' t order the shrimp salads you will be underwhelmed .
Location is convenient . Food is alright . Drinks could improve . No bad experiences , but nothing to rave about .
You know what you are getting . Come on , this isn ' t the best pizza in town , but close enough to many homes in the Southern Ave and 19Th avenue basin .
Nice selection of Barbour products and stacks of Orvis Foundry Cloth pants . What more could you want ? This location is quite large and has a very good fly fishing gear section in the back .
Food was good . Portions are big . Cool Rat Pack - Sopranos decor . But the overall experience only rated 3 stars . I expected more .
The sushi was amazing but the hibachi portions were so small in comparison for the price . Go to ginza for hibachi !
TOURIST TRAP TOURIST TRAP . Overcrowded . Uncomfortable You can get exactly the same products at different places .
Interesting gallery space . Went for an event and thought it was a nice open venue w lots of fans and cool art .
The donuts were ok , one seemed to be dried out . Close to $ 9 for six donuts that I would rate average so I give it 3 stars .
It gets way too crowded now that they closed the 101 and baseline gym . LA Fitness needs to build another to accomodate the overflow in the Tempe and Chandler areas .
Nice cheap eat , like fast food , it ' s busy for lunch hour but people have it done quickly so not long wait . Down side is no service , you have to get tea by yourself
Good Food . but my goodness , portion sizes are so small . AND it ' s EXPENSIVE as hell . They have the BEST iced green tea ! definitely give that a try !
Decent handmade Mexican food . Service has always been good when I ' ve gone . The fajitas compared to a place like Lone Star didn ' t hold up but the Burritos weren ' t too bad .
Food was ok - not bad , not great . I had the Pernil Asado tacos and the Short Rib Barbacoa tacos . The service was excellent . I would dine there again .
It was alright ! Ended up with a person who was new and not very experienced . Did a OK job . Still nice place .
Average soccer fields , parking can be difficult close in but can always find parking at high school and walk over . Have playground .
Update . BEWARE The Soda is terrible and the glasses are tiny .
50 ' s diner setting with counter & tables for large portioned breakfasts . Food was good . Selected 3 choices for omelet .
Like In - N - Out with peanuts everywhere . Only twice the price . But without the drive - thru or the paper hats .
I was a little surprised by my fried rice which was on the sweet side . I didn ' t really like it . Otherwise the curry was good .
Service was surprisingly average at best , which was a shock since it was a Sunday mid afternoon . Food is average chain restaurant . . . . nothing great and yet nothing below average .
We came here for birthday dinner . The preserved New York steak is not as good , but the Ribeye is much better ,
Tried this place only once and they have good nihari and not so good beef kabab . The food is little pricy for the quantity they give .
Stopped here to fill jugs with water . The area is kept clean but does not have enough parking spaces if you are there to get something other than gas .
So . . . is it ok with management to blast music that blantantly has cursing and offensive lyrics when children are in the shop ? Drinks we good
This place was ok compared to other buffets . The hours should be extended since it is Vegas and no one wakes up that early here .
Great burgers and fries . . . not the speediest of service and drive through has been removed .
Good south Indian food . Chass is good to cool off ! Evenings are not the best time to go . Takes a lot of time to get the food .
Service is a Lil slow . My turkey sandwich was tasty but the fries were not too fresh and the oil in the deep fryers is in a desperate need to be changed
Great for intimate shows and showcases , not the best concert venue though . The noise level gets really bad with the reverb .
I liked the people and service and understand tgey are students but 4 1 / 2 hrs for a pedi full - set .
The food is just okay here I don ' t feel like it should be a Mexican cooking your Chinese food I ' ve had much better Panda Express elsewhere for some reason they ' re slacking sorry guys
It ' s 3 months after my initial review and the prosecco is still not chilled enough . What up ? ? ? ?
Le bar le plus mythique à mtl , une ambiance festive et rock n roll , alcool à prix modique , 2 ambiance 7 / 10
Nice looking restaurant . Did not have to wait long to be seated on Saturday night . Fried rice did not have much flavour .
Nothing outstanding but a good value for the price . Most items were good , a few not as hot as you might like . Service was timely and friendly .
Employees looked as if they were chained to their stations . The least they could do is smile at the fact they ' re gainfully employed
Not many dip options . Pedicure is just okay . They won ' t service you if you come in 45 min before close .
Good food but so expensive comparing For the food they serve , the service is great the margaritas need to be better although they said it was made from scratch but didn ' t buy that
It was ok . Margaritas are terrible . Server was great and tacos were good . But $ 4 a taco is not a good price .
So small , airlines limited ! But descent restaurants , my only issues were with the airline not the airport .
Really warm and friendly staff , delicious margarita pizza ! Will definitely go back and excited to try other things on the menu !
It was ok - Bang Bang is much better . They don ' t make their own ice cream and charge extra to cut the sandwich in half .
Just to let everyone know , I was contacted via Yelp by the manager who offered an apology and to make things right . There needs to be more people like that .
Just stopped here for a few drinks . Menu was a little weak but the bartender hooked us up with something we liked . I ' ll look forward to getting back here to try some grub soon !
Creamy and authentic gelato but nothing too special . They serve traditional flavors which are well done but I ' d like to see more creative flavors .
The Good Egg was a good place for a fast breakfast . Food was ok and the service was courteous and attentive !
I frequently stop in here on my way home from work when I need to ship out a package . Staff is always friendly and helpful .
Very tasty and most everything on the menu has gluten free . Pizza looked good but went with some very nice pasta . Good experience .
Nice live acoustic music on the wknds . Beer & wine . Ambiance leaves a little to be desired . Great breakfast place . Same ambiance ( stark ) .
Always good ! Located in the Target / Kohl ' s shopping center .
Decent selection . Great for meeting with classmates to knockout projects . Has a coffee shop with snacks and pastries .
This park is great for dogs but has declined in maintainace . All the grass is dead in the large dog areas and there is no shade trees or places to sit in the beach area .
The delivery was timely , but the tandoori chicken was rather tasteless ( got medium spice ) . Go with one of the spicier options to avoid the blandness .
Fair breakfast . Came here because of reviews . Unfortunately , restaurant is ' over ' rated . It was ok . Potatoes a bit salty .
$ 21 for two affogato ! ! Tasted good just not sure it was worth it . Oh well , it ' s Vegas .
I ' m giving it three stars because delivery was really fast . The only problem is the food was not that great . It was missing something and the potsticker were gummy .
Espresso game strong with a quick pull and a pour . If your debating on the breaking burro or Sammy . Pull the trigger on the burro its damn clutch !
I was at this UPS Store just yesterday , and had a pleasant experience . I was completely unorganized with an armful of stuff and the worker was patient with me and helped me pack the box .
Stek and cheese sub was fine . The lack of seating is abysmal . Restrooms not avail - that ' s a first .
Was expecting a bit more . My chicken sandwhich was a thin piece of chicken , but I kinda liked it . But really , the food was average fast food at sit down restaurant prices .
Dad ' s tomato sandwich was just okay . . sorry I thought it would have more of a tomato taste
Just better than average date spot with a good wine selection . In spite of my own personal nostalgia for it , it ' s only decent Italian .
Good price but ramen is so bland . Servers are nice . Restaurant still seems very popular .
Hard to access with new LRT construction , old tv ' s in restaraunt area , not many booths . But food was good , what you would expect from any boston pizza .
A little bit sweet for me . Not a big fan . The pancakes are delicious but don ' t think I ' ll go back for those sweet
Very clean , service was ok , food was hot but not much to write home about . There was enough it just lacked flavour . We were traveling so it was a decent cheap lunch .
Standard fish n chips . I was happy with my food . The atmosphere was nice . I ' d go back .
This place was ok . They had a huge selection of items to choose from ( as do most AYCE restaurants ) but the food is mediocre .
This is a casual bar with a kind of older - ish crowd ( older than most of old town ) . Still kind of frat - y / cliquey .
Korean diners will be a bit disappointed with the food and banchan . The steamed egg was good . The rest not so . Tasted old . Meats were ok . . . a bit chewy .
Tomo always been our favorite place to go for sushi but the portion and services has gone down , but it ' s still good and close to home
kind of expensive . We did three doors ( front door , side door and door to garage ) and got charged for $ 270 . I think it ' s very expensive
food here is alright , meat is the same as other kbbq , service was a little slow at night and some food was not brought out
Went for shortening the wrist chain of my wrist watch . They did it well for $ 10 . They have some wall clocks etc . too though not a lot .
Nice play area . Annoying older lady that works here is constantly going in to fuss at all the kids though . Super rude . Typical food , polite cadhiers .
This would totally get 4 - 5 stars if they closed the garage door when it ' s so cold outside ! Everyone inside is wearing jackets : (
The food is good . We go there for breakfast . . But the guy who owns it is RUDE ! Not a good place to take your kids , he doesn ' t have patience for them .
Solid Johnny Rockets location . Plenty of seating . Service was friendly and not too slow . Lots of bad reviews here , but I had a good experience . It was A - OK ! 3 stars !
Well this is hardly an original place to go . The big box electronics store . That being said , it has a large selection and when in a bind , gets the job done .
Very good food and friendly staff . You always get your money ' s worth . The ambience is a little much for my taste but hey it ' s a diner so it ' s expected .
Ship - wrecked burger is great . Mac and cheese is bland . Service was good .
Tavern Pub with a slab of underground ! Inexpensive pub in the middle if many expensive pubs . Perfect for music lovers
The meatball is supposed to be a specialty . . . no Bueno . Not even close to any decent Italian joint . Beer good though , and service very passable
Food is average . Service a little slow but very nice staff . Busy place , casual atmosphere . On the plus side , the prices are great .
Great wood and great prices , but it ' s really hit or miss if you find someone running the fork lift who has valuable experience loading . Be careful .
Food is good but service is usually horrible ! You can hear the waitstaff and bartenders complaining about life . . Location is also horrible !
Close to my house so I go here once and a while . Slices have usually been sitting around but for a whole pizza they ' re pretty decent
Good food .
I went for a free brake check was not told I was going to be charged $ 50 for a diagnostic on the ABS unit should not charge people without telling them beforehand
I like the fresh taste of their pizza . Don ' t know the ambience or service - we always do takeout . Preferable to typical chain pizza .
Unlike the other reviewers I did not go in for service I was there for a part . The staff where friendly and helpful . Unfortunately they did not have the part I needed .
Keeps getting better and better . The Commons across the street is better during the day . If you are partying at night , this is your spot .
food was good . Service was slow . Just keep an eye on your waiter to see if he / she is getting what u asked for .
Glad to find nice selections . I must add that the staff , particularly Derrik and Will , were very helpful to me .
Not bad . Not great Food quality is decent . Menu has great dishes . Execution sucks . Service is nowhere to be found . Too bad the place could be very good with some passion and or management
Pretty standard dollar store . Items are well stocked and floors are relatively clean . Only problem is that the cashiers seem rather slow .
Great vibes . Definitely had a lot of positive anticipation coming in . Food was good but tater tots and grits can only be so delicious . Expensive .
The breeze is cool . Not too fancy . The drinks are a little watery but the grub is decent .
Had the vanilla soufflé with mango sauce fresh made and it was great but a little too sweet for my liking . Prices are reasonable and their sweet pear - ing tea is flagrantly tasteful too .
Six Shooter Roll & Jericho the great roll - It was good and cheap , but not as fresh as it use to be . To me the key to great sushi is really fresh fish .
After a Garth Brooks fantastic concert we stopped by for the first time ! I was starving no food served after 11 : 00 ugh People that work here not so friendly , better luck next time !
Had dinner recently and discovered that it is just a bar . However the waitress did seem genuinely interested in our food and service . Will probably not visit again .
Average pizza could be better ! ! And the portion size is very big like who needs a 28 inch pizza slice
Food was good and reasonable . Service was very slow . I had the steak burrito . It was big and good . However , don ' t be in a rush .
The food and atmosphere was alright . The service was great . They don ' t have lunch specials so it ' s a bit pricey to go for lunch . It ' s basically okay . . .
They give away confirmed group reservations at random leaving you stranded upon arrival .
TEMPE , AZ : This Starbucks is a drive through only . Pretty centrally located and with a couple of tables outside for a walk - up option . No restroom , though , be forewarned !
Not as good Kroger . Not as friendly as Kroger but the prices are nice . I would probably come back .
Belle deco verte , plein de choix santé , ferme tot par example , ecrans de tv , plein de tables , jus d ' orange frais : )
Great customer service , jerky very pricey . . . a liitle hard for my taste . . . idk . . . Ok I suppose . .
Went to play bingo the caller was a lil to fast for my liking , other then that food was good nice spot to go to if your on this side of town : )
The veal sandwich was good but was a little pricy for a sandwich . Additional toppings also requires additional cost . Tasty sandwich and friendly customer service though .
Love love love the food ! ! ! Stop raising the prices you guys are good but go easy on those prices ! ! !
Food was good but it ' s pretty pricey . Nothing special about the food . Seems like typical backyard summer BBQ food .
Noisy atmosphere seems to be the spot for regulars to visit .
The experience of cooking meat on a hot rock was rather interesting but overall it ' s a little on the pricey side . I also ordered an Australian lamb shank which was ok .
Class act with the follow up - and glad management listened to sites like this . Won ' t be back - but again thanks for acknowledging
4 stars for atmosphere . 2 stars for food and service and that ' s being generous . I was really disappointed because i was hoping for some great food . Nothing special .
Pretty small and tight seating area , washroom were really dirty , servers had hard time communicating , but food and drink were delicious and menu selection is lengthy .
Food was alright , but they are pretty pricey for the quality of food . Portion sizes were decent though !
Dated but nice hotel with nice location to thr airport . Have stayed here multiple times due to flight delays / cancellations .
Good home cooking with very friendly atmosphere . Seemed liked the wait staff knew everybody !
Here they have a variety of good beers . Nice , clean looking atmosphere . However their food is mediocre and overpriced . I will come back to drink here but not to eat .
The barista Karen needs her Starbucks morning shot . She is always in a bad mood . Just sayin The coffee is always good though . . .
I used to rate this restaurant at 5 stars , but lately the quality has seriously declined . I am officially on the hunt for a new favorite Thai restaurant .
It ' s alright . I ' m liking Whole Foods better . This store has very small selections and I want to just make 1 stop .
Chilli chicken . . . nothing to write home about ! Very spicy but no flavour . If you want cheap , it is but it ' s not good . I pick Federicks any day !
First time there and the food was cold coming to the table . Silverware looked like it wasn ' t rinsed . The atmosphere was nice though
tasty but a bit expensive given the small - ish portions . you also have to not mind a very simple , almost - no - seating interior ( which i don ' t mind )
Service is awful ! their sushi is wonderful but they ' re overwhelmed with work and not enough staff
My boyfriend wanted to check this place out , so I tagged along . There is a nice selection of cars here . Too bad that all we can do was dream about having one !
Neat patio . Nothing too special . Food quality is quite standard . Great for post work beverage with colleagues . 3 . 25 / 5 *
The food is pretty good for the prices . I haven ' t been back since they expanded and remodeled but it looks super nice !
Augh . . . . . . get back to you . Not good . Oh no not at all . Seriously this is like my local sushi spot . For the price it ' s a RIP off
For yogurt it ' s great customer service . . . So so , very clean large selection now if only the employees acknowledged you and smiled !
Small menu and pricey drinks . My small iced coffee , which is comparable in size to a tall at Starbucks , was $ 6 . 50 . The workers there are friendly .
I ' m so bummed you guys don ' t deliver anymore . I guess I ' ll see you when I ' m in your neck of the woods : ( \ Figure out your delivery please !
Tuna tacos come with a very refreshing mango salsa . The tuna is raw but if you ' re not scared of that , it ' s great .
Très sympa et chaleureux comme endroit ! les prix sont un peu chers mais la qualité est là et le service est très bon
Good spot for lunch with lots of options from a make your own salad to sandwiches , soups , and pasta . Not to mention free soft serve ice cream at the end .
I love spam and eggs . Biscuits serves them and gives vets a 10 % discount . Good enough for me .
Came back here again with friends . I kept hearing nothing but good things and my experience was still , " meh " . It has a cool atmosphere but the food is really nothing special .
Interesting experience , not that pleasant experience with customer service provided by Cailey and Katie . Maybe we should have explored others .
Just stopped in for ice cream . It was good and the pizza smelled great . I would come back and try their food . Plenty of seating inside and benches outside . Workers were friendly .
I was not impressed with the food presentation , the ambiance nor the value of this resturante . I don ' t think it will be on my list of restaurant recommendations .
Nice decor but the food was not as good as expected . I have to admit the mock cocktail was delicious . My husband is vegan so we were a bit disappointed .
Great downtown location , wonderful staff and terrific service . The food was good , nothing mind blowing , just kind or average . Lots of potential though because the space and ambience is great !
Reasonably good . The service was pleasant , but the room was cold . The dough was too thick on the perimeter of the pizza . Try the homemade hot sauce , though . It was tasty .
Great food , horrible service . . they rush you . . . and food came out at all different times . . . go to Black Kettle Kitchen in Phoenix
I had never had dosai until this place opened . Every version I ' ve tried is yummy ! The accompanying sauces , however , can be a little too heavy and spicy for me .
This was fun but I went for free . Not sure I would have paid $ 100 + to go see it but my mom would have loved it .
Pros : Big burrito . Nice staff . Cons : Most plain Jane burrito that doesn ' t fill you up . Seems clean but not my first choice
Ray ' s is a greasy - pizza lover ' s wet dream . Be sure to plan your dieting around this place as you are sure to have higher cholesterol when leaving ! ! ! : )
They shouldn ' t put new employees in the drive thru . Had to repeat our order 5 times . Who doesn ' t know that when you order a hamburger that means no cheese .
It was alright . But I thought Sunsplash had better more " Adult " slides . Big Sur has mostly tubed slides . I like the open slides . Eh , its a waterpark . Whatever .
They have a fantastic selection . Right on mineral point road next to Quik Trip . Some of the staff is friendly . Reasonable .
Hey it ' s Starbucks , so the coffee is good , but the lines are amazing ! I only stop here when I really , really need a caffeine fix !
The jerk chicken was great . Shrimp appetizer was a little disappointing . Service was slow but friendly
Why is the water in the fountain dyed blue ? Nice views . Lots of ducks . Good parky break from the city .
We go several times a month after church . Service is always good . I ' ve tried the classic burger - big but only adequate . The Belgian chocolate pancakes and waffles are wonderful !
Just walked by today and they were cleaning up getting ready to open . . . ! great location , great cars and SUV ' S .
The food was just average , staff are very friendly . Good to have a mex restaurant close by .
I am a fan of quiznos . Adding this place to my lunch routine because A ) it tastes good and B ) its cheap !
Nice , feel good home cooked Filipino food when you ' re missing your moms cooking . Doesnt disappoint .
Food is good . But take so long must be the weekend maybe . Service is so so you see the server when you order and then when you check bill . . . .
Have always loved Little Ceasars . Disturbing though when an employee has his girlfriend drop him off Barro ' s pizza in the lobby in front of customers .
This place is more a westernized version of Vietnamese . Double down was good and the Mekong noodle soup had good flavor and generous portons . Do not get the papaya salad . Tasted a d smelled rancid .
Pretty tasty dogs . Pretty long wait for a hot dog .
The ambiance was great ; waitstaff was excellent ; wine selection was on point . Almost all of the food we tried was too salty / had too many capers .
For a local place we really like it the Burgers and Fries Are outstanding the air conditioner is too cold but we keep coming back
Pssst , this location has been closed . Drove to the location today and area where Smashburger was initially located is vacant and sign has been removed . ( Reported to Yelp )
Dark , dreary and dusty . Not a very welcoming atmosphere . Reminds me of a cheap bar . Service was good and food and drinks were decent . But maybe put some more lights on ?
The Brussels wafles are exactly like the ones served at Le Petit Dejeuner without having to line up outside . Service was fast and friendly . Will try the Bennies next time .
Best Pizza Slice amongst Toronto Universities period , then they changed ownership : ( . It ' s just ok now , but amazing sauce , crust too light now and cheese is average . Wah !
Did was average , ambiance was typical fast food and service was nothing special . Solid 3 star place .
Fun place , lots of duck paraphenalia , and celbrity photos . Expect to pay top dollar for candy , but you ' ll have fun doing it . ( $ 14 / lb in the bulk bins )
The two divisions of planting and tree removal need better communication . The staff that come to the house are courteous , and attentive .
Very mediocre burgers . Sweet potato fries were better than the burger with their spicy mayo sauce . Otherwise , I thought the burger was very bland and nothing unique about it .
Last time I went they put way too much salt on my fries . Felt like my mouth was burning : - /
I love firehouse subs and frequent the one off Rainbow . Ordered online for pick up twice now at this location and both times orders have been wrong .
good ice cream but small place . . if it had a little more space would have been nice to sit and eat the ice cream
Good variety , really good prizes , service could be better . Sales people are really not interested in helping you find the right jeans model but are at least smiling . .
Food was average . Assortment is limited . Dessert is jello and small pastry . Could be better . More toward Chinese then American Chinese . Was part of a tour .
Pleasantly surprised w / the White Chili . Pretty tasty . And thank you Rockne ' s for having Elliott Ness on Tap ! : )
It wasn ' t amazing , it didn ' t suck . Not dying to go back . The hotel is so lovely we wanted something brilliant and it just wasn ' t there .
We love our now daily trips to the stores that sell things we never had any idea existed ! Thank you lowes for stocking such things !
The food here was OK . Not the best burger I ' ve had but some interesting combinations . Definitely overpriced . But we had good service and over all the food was decent
Food is excellent ! Their salads have decreased in size , but not price . The service needs drastic improvement !
Nice place . We had a good experience . The music was wayyyyyyyyyy to loud thogh . Food was under average . Love the remodeling though
I love their desserts but service isn ' t that great . Make sure to bring cash cause they are cash only . I ordered their taro sago mix and enjoyed it
In the store . They get me in & out . Drive thru wise . I wait 10 almost 15 minutes waiting for a tea . Absolutely ridiculous . But I like going inside to get out faster .
Had dinner here on my bday . . . food was good , service was average . . . didn ' t like the wait time for hibachi chef to get going . . . just an average experience
Took the wife to get her mani pedi . . . . she says it was OK . asked her how many stars out of 5 , so 3 it is .
Don ' t want to be harsh to these compas but I agree with one of the previous reviews : nice and clean and decent sandwich but with a low value price ratio .
I got the grand Mac , it was good but the sweet tea was old . Stay away from there sweet tea . Most McDonald ' s have good sweet tea but freshness is the key
Another placeholder so my pictures link . I ' ll update with details later , but the 3 star rating holds true .
home plate was ok I tried it for the first time about a week ago nothing special but the server was really nice and the food was just ok the burger looked good though
Tacos are yummy ! The people are always friendly ! I go for lunch and I get my food in plenty of time to enjoy it !
Come here to use the wifi a lot but its pretty slow most of the time . Food can be fresh probably 65 - 70 % of the time .
This is not Constantino any more it under different management plz update this Yelp entry
Slow service but food is always worth the wait one of the best delis in town very reasonably priced
Not a huge on franchise / chains . Having said that the food was good . If you are looking for a quick healthy meal , you can get it here .
Last year I remembered it tasty and fresh ! Just normal this year during rush hour at noon . . . : - (
This used to be my favorite boba spot ! The flavors has changed . It seems more diluted and not as flavorful . Also the 4 boba I bought is not even full ! !
We have been coming here for a while now and after today I see it slipping in service and food . I hope it ' s not because I really like this place
Decent sushi , especially good quality for a lunch buffet . Wouldn ' t necessarily go out of my way to come here again but given how cheap the lunch buffet is the quality definitely stood out .
Pretty interiors but needs to improve on service time . Too bad it was crowded and you can ' t really get the great ambiance .
A pretty much generic Walgreens in a pretty much generic shopping center in the large sprawl that is the greater Phoenix area . . . Has everything you would expect to find .
The food is good but 20 minutes for tacos on a Sunday afternoon is a little long . People ordering after us getting their food before us ( tacos )
Typical Chinese restaurant . Cheap , quick , decent quality . Very much like every other Chinese restaurant I ' ve been too . Not as bad as some of the reviews I read on here .
Very different atmosphere and very limited menu . Considerably less seating for diners than before , bar seating has expabded . Probably not looking to return
Good basic hotel . Only negatives were the hounding in the lobby area to sign up for " presentations " likely to sell stuff and NO COFFEE POT in the room . Otherwise fine .
The food here is delicious and fresh . The decoration and atmosphere is luxurious and modern . This seafood restaurant is perfect for family reunions , business meetings and birthday parties . Highly recommended !
Love Lancasters and the food was nice . The place was way to cold and the AC seemed to bounce off the walls . The food was really good and the waitress was super nice though .
The Saxe lounge is just the bar you wait in before enterting the Saxe theater . Nothing special here . However , I would suggest you purchase a ticket and actually go see into the theater .
Meat market . Thought the name meant beer or good drinks . Beers were pricey . Yes it ' s Scottsdale . Had to leave . Just wanted a beer and the game
Don ' t really like barbecue food but since this is really famous I went with friends . Good thing is they have bar compared to Lil Porgy , but Porgy is much cheaper .
Buffet had decent food selections during my visit here but overall taste of the food was not very authentic . Not sure I will return to this place .
Decent food . Accommodating hosts - I am sensitive to spicy foods and they made me a special dish even though I was having the buffet . Bathroom could be cleaner .
Best lunch special The Lunch specials are great . . U get a big meal for your money . . I would recommend # 1
This place was pretty good . I ' d give it 3 . 5 stars . Had some tacos and carne asada nachos . Really cheap - the tacos were 90 cents each .
The custard is nice , but little flavor variety . Only 3 flavors . The people working at this place have little patience for the indecisive .
Nice ambiance . Better than average cuisine , nicely presented , but not overly special . Great service . Overall experience is good .
Above average in taste & presentation , which is unusual for a casino location . Flavors and sauces are really good .
Great place to catch a live local band friendly atmosphere and great beer specials . A $ 20 goes a good distance here .
Just needed a room for the night on NYE . A lot of booked hotels so took this one hotel was ok for the night , but Denetha at the front desk was friendly and very helpful !
Great little brunch spot . All local and organic food . Service was friendly , atmosphere was a little lacking . Will definitely go back .
This is your average pub . Nothing special , but not bad either , especially for the price . I know they do a happy hour where they have food and drinks for ridiculously cheap which is great .
Food not bad , but lousy service . I could not believe I got refused twice ( 2 different servers ) for just asking for a fork , as they said I would not need it . WHAT ?
Positive : good latte , nice spacious patio for the summer season . Negative : $ 7 for a medium size latte , you make Starbucks looks cheap .
Funny , the same stuff gets executed much better here than in Atlanta ' s NW location , which I reviewed a few weeks ago . Service was fine here too .
Saturday and Sunday they ONLY serve brunch . If you come in be aware that the standard menu will NOT apply .
Good , but not great . Ordered Thai hot but there was zero heat . Seems like each location has a different cook method .
Food was good except the curled meat in the photo . It was supposed to be beef but tasted like pork that was in the freezer too long . This was the set menu called Las Vegas
Walmart is a good place to shop for stuff , but there is not that much sales , and it is just not the best place to shop at .
Good food , not as good as it used to be . My favorite is the egg stuffed French toast and the mashed potato omelette .
Food ' s good and avocado on the menu . Yay ! However , what ' s with the styrofoam cups and plastic burger boxes ? Seems a little tone - deaf for 2013 .
I ordered the Hawaiian plate . The portion was plenty , but it wasn ' t the best Hawaiian food I ' ve had . The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean .
Traditional pub food . Casual atmosphere geared towards bar and patio fun . Food is okay if you like pub food .
Love the apps . platter great for sharing and sampling Service is average . Wings are great we love the branded dill sauce ! I think it ' s one of things that keep us coming !
Great food and drink but super unfriendly and awkward server . Will give it one more try .
decent coffee . large cookies . busy study environment . hip .
Pleasantly surprised when me and my friends found this place while visiting Phoenix from LA for the weekend . Good prices , good food , and I absolutely love the vibe there !
If you can get past the reality that this place isn ' t very clean , it is solid food . 4 stars if I had not been forced to find a clean table . Naan was legit !
Moxies is Moxies - it ' s a chain and you ' ll always get consistency . As a location , it ' s great in the East Beaver Creek corridor with nice patio and friendly staff .
ehhhh it ' s alright . They have a good bbq chicken pizza . Spotty service and drinks .
So far so good . Early Saturday after Christmas . Small crowd . TSA check in had no wait .
空港近くのホテル。無料送迎のシャトルバスあり。レンタカーの返却場所までは、ガススタンドがあり安心だが、駐車場までは意外と時間がかかり10分ほど必要なので要注意。部屋はきれいで問題なし。ただ空港近くの為、飛行機の音が大きいが、耳栓を用意してくれている気配りあり。受付の女性も、非常に感じの良い対応をして頂いた。
The drive - thru is more like a slow - thru half the time I come here but I ' ve never had a drink order wrong ! Starbucks is Starbucks though .
The service is hit or miss , either great or terrible . If you ask for soy it either is made wrong or has clumps in it .
Cute little restaurant . We went for brunch on a Sunday . We weren ' t in a hurry , so the wait for our food wasn ' t a problem , but it did take surprising long .
The meat was pretty good and filing . If you need a high calorie meal this is a good place . So far I cannot find a truely good GYRO in the west .
Love this place Staffs are very friendly Food is ver little they are very stingy but i still love chipotle .
Best Vanilla Chai . Worst service . They almost always mess up my order or forget something . Also , RUDE .
The food is alright and a comfortable setting . I like to come in here from time to time .
Taco breakfast full of meats and colors of the rainbow . It ' s like the calm after the storm . Lot of red green and yell
Place with a decent meal with huge portions . Nothing extraordinary , but will definitely fill you up . I have the Rice noodle with pickled veggies and pork .
Second time here . First in 2012 . Food not impressive . Fish tacos are much better elsewhere . Pork tacos were crazy plain .
They use really cheap quality salads . The place is a good example of quantity over quality . All the rolls are gigantic but aren ' t too tasty . Presentation also below average .
If you ' re going here through the week leave before 2 p . m . or plan on waiting around . Staff is friendly on the upside .
We stopped by for dim sum . . The restaurant was very busy . So I expected to get fresh food . Several items were cold . Very disappointing .
Came for brunch once and enjoyed it so I decided to try dinner . Ambiance is nice , outside seating available for the Spring and Summer months , staff is friendly , and food is delightful !
For a chain , it is better atmosphere than you would expect . The menu options all sound delicious , but the food quality is not great . Just mediocre .
Decent , cheap thai food . It is greasy , saucy , and uses chilli sauce instead of chilli paste or dried chilli . The restaurant is rather empty most of the time so service is fast .
Soso expected more but hey . Its one of the originals . Cool to just walk across the street and just hang out at nite .
Good pub food and good beer . Nothing fantastic , but it is a staple in our family because pretty much everything is consistently good .
Loved the $ 5 hamburger special on Monday night , unfortunately I asked for medium - rare and got well - done . Other times the food was good , casual atmosphere . Meets our expectations .
A wise man once told me , " Don ' t teach the ' gwei lo ' new tricks . " I never understood what that meant until I ate here .
Burger was excellent and Mac and cheese was quite good , however , a tad more expensive than your regular pub or bar .
A little expensive , also often they run out of stuff . . 3 stars to 4 hopefully with theyr improvments . .
Magic hat number 9 is a refreshing summer ale . The fish burrito was large and very filling . Service was attentive .
Appetizers were good , as was service . Lots of local beer choices . Good atmosphere . Did not have dinner so will comment next time .
Food is delicious and great presentation . Too bad their customer service is horrible . They brought us wrong entree and then wanted to charge us for it . Plus they took for ever to bring the check .
Pizza is amazing . Surprisingly , during happy hour you can wait awhile for service to show up if you decide to sit on the patio , especially in the summer .
The pineapple pork sandwich was delicious ! Chips are ok . Could use flavor . Server was great . I ' d come back .
I like this place , the food is pretty good and they got good looking ladies working here . next time I ' ll just get the bbq . The steak is a little too chard .
The chicken was good but the sauce on them was not my favourite . too much salt on the fries . the service was good .
Good . I enjoyed my skillet , and my family enjoyed their meals . I appreciate the great service and healthy options .
Liquor and beer selection seems to be great , but we were looking for a glass of wine . Not great for our needs .
The owner finally reimbursed me for the money I lost at this car wash .
Its okay , not really the street tacos I expected . No salsa bar or mayo cream for the fish and shrimp tacos or guacamole . Service is good . Recommend tortilla fish tacos down the street lol
Food was ok , they basically just drown it with teriyaki sauce . Patricia was great though . 5 / 5 for her
Great social mission . Okay - ish food . Decent location . Untrained service .
Always delicious but you wait a while . Workers always pleasent and ready to help . Table was a little dirty but with no trash can in sight , i guess that might be expected .
Been there countless times for their pan - fried dumplings and eggplant hotpot . Otherwise , a perfectly fine cheap - Chinese restaurant .
Don ' t agree with all of the hype Great atmosphere and location . But the food is just bland sadly . Still the concept is great and its a appreciated part of Charlotte thus 3 stars .
Very average breakfast at prices higher than the food is worth . We were seated immediately and the service and food were quick .
Dark , cheap , and serving those of questionable content and character . Total win !
I would say the dim sum is pretty good during weekend but not the weekdays . Food : The crepes of the rice rolls ( 腸粉 ) were too thick . .
Well stocked record store with a smaller selection of used records compared to new .
Top notch food with amazingly quick delivery to my apartment door . Delivery was more of the pleasure having silver dragon .
I love the atmosphere and the concept . So good for downtown . I enjoyed all the food but it ' s just too pricey for what you get .
This place is ridiculously slow , just to get seated on a day that isn ' t very busy . Don ' t eat here if you have a plane to catch .
All I have to say is awesome burgers and staff but they need to update their plans for the drive threw . Lines are always too long .
Clean and easy to navigate . I haven ' t had to park here , but the kiss - n - fly line is pretty efficient . Hopkins has everything you could want from an airport .
This location needs to improve on its menu . Not a lot of variety . The staff is very nice and attentive and the location is awesome .
I ' ve only bought a loaf of bread and it was very good ! I ' ll be back for more ! The menu looks great .
Extremely slow service . Excellent venue and very cool environment but idk if the food is that food . Crab bisque is delicious . Would go again , maybe only for happy hour and appetizers
Little bar next to the hospital . Service was pretty bad but the food was good and the drinks are the cheapect in town . I may go there again to try more of the menu .
Good service , nice portions . . but honestly , the meat isn ' t the best . It ' s ok . . just not top notch .
The taste is very good . But the service is too slooooow . If you are not hurry for the next stop and wanna try some Thailand foods , please come here .
It ' s An Ok Restaurant . . Nothing Special . . Just Like Earls Or Moxies . Don ' t Care To Go Back .
The food is good , the service is great and the place is inviting !
Just another nice Amir food nothing more but renovated food court and very clean . I always like eat pita when hungry .
Waited forever for service . Wasn ' t disappointed with the food though . The staff just needs to be provided with help during the busy times
Ordered a veggie panini - it was more of a crispy burrito . Not bad - but not my favorite meal . But quality of ingredients was good .
Some parts of the mall are renovated and other parts are ghetto . They need a major renovation and make it up to par with Yorkdale Mall or Sherway Gardens .
+ Cheap beer + Great deals on food + Decent pub food + Wings are good + TV ' s everywhere + Giant Screen in the middle excellent for watching sports
So bf and I went here we been to rubbish before but this one there chips we too overcooked and so salty ! 3 stars cause the burrito was good and filled me up
Decent grub , one of the few offerings of vegetarian options in the area , a little loud once the mariachi got going
I always like the meatloaf , mashed potatoes and green beans . This Bob Evans was like the others . Average chain service . Good when needing something familiar : - )
Cute little gambling area . Kind of dirty , but what else can you expect from a tiny " casino " .
I really didn ' t get to see a lot of the Arizona Republic . I had a meeting on one of the top floors , and it was very nice and had a great view .
the chicken is great . I rather eat ground beef at different places .
The food is generally pretty good not great . Kind of pricey compared to similar types of Japanese steakhouses that offer a Groupon or Living Social deal .
The ice cream is good , although they use mini marshmellows rather than marshmellow swirl in their rocky road , not my thing . The atmosphere is kitchy ; very pink .
One of the newer hotel casinos . Good location South of the strip . I like the movie theater and the rewards perks . The buffet is just average but the prime rib on Sunday is great .
Not authentic Mexican food , but for fast food , this is , perhaps , the best option . The food is filling , the staff here are well mannered , and it is clean .
Appetizers . Edamame great . Veggie rolls - best thing sauce . Wings - super weird and greasy . Beef stew great . Ramen good . Staff wonderful
How can you go wrong with fresh baguettes ? ? However I tried their croissants and they tasted like yeast and eggy . . . but the baguettes are perfect !
it was alright . . . nothing special and really expensive for a small sub , chips and a drink . probably wont be back .
The food wasn ' t horrible but it wasn ' t that flavorful either . I ordered carne asada nachos and they were just meh .
Had a bit of a problem with our garage door making too much noise , but the owner of the company took care of the problem .
The people who work here are always friendly , as expected from AMC , but the seats in this particular theater are frakking ridiculously uncomfortable .
Our first time . Ambience is great but noisy during lunch hour . Sitting out is the best option . Food was okay . I ' m an ardent Thai fan so had to visit this restaurant .
Had their " signature " dry aged NY strip . Not very special . Go for the rib eye or Prime rib . Service was great , but for the price the food could be much better .
Split an omelet platter with a friend . The veggie omelet , fries , etc were fairly decent . The service was not the best given the server ' s attitude but whatever .
Once again I came on to get lunch and the staff was sweeping and mopping floor while customers are eating . Time was 2 : 32 pm Not good , while people are eating .
It was clean . Staff are super rude . It ' s hard to find everything . It ' s just an average Walmart y ' all . .
This is a nice clean place . Food is good but not great . It satisfies my gyro craving but makes me miss the Greek from Astoria , Queens .
Staff is friendly , selection is so - so , which is about what can be expected for a shop of this size . Middle of the road for used bookstores in Vegas .
Loved the half price deal before 4pm ! Sushi is good but you get what you pay for here . I ' ve had worst so this is a good place if you want a quick sushi fix .
Good Brunch , nice service . Kinda big . I guess it ' s not fair to want Vegas to do things in moderation
Det var helt ok men desværre glemte de halvdelen af vores mad og da det var take away , så klagede vi ikke over det . Men generelt helt ok mad
Well it ' s Denny ' s so my expectations wasn ' t that high . Not bad late night hunger . . .
Heard great reviews but it was just okay . Loved our server bit atmosphere was lacking .
Great food , shitty service . Get takeout with an app and enjoy your stuff to go . Cookies are maybe best in the city .
Finally the phone number is available for reservations . Now if only the reviews would improve , I ' d give it a shot .
SDM ' s trademark ' Do Not Enter ' swinging door has been installed to the right of the entrance . This means you gotta go left , fools .
Nothing special , missed quite a few hairs , however did listen when told not to make them too thin .
The biscuit was delicious . However , the fried chicken was mediocre , and everything was a little bit too expensive for the amount of food . The side of fruit was measly .
The chicken and jojos are very good but the two times I tried their pizza I was very disappointed . It was so dry it was hard to tell which was the pizza and which was the box .
Food was good service was slow I don ' t know why there was only 5 tables being served .
I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the crab legs with the trifecta seasoning was ! However , I ' m not a fan of working for my food or how messy it was .
Mmmmmmmm love poulet portugais roti mmmm , les oignons croustillants et la salade choux cremeuse bonne aussi , les frites pas grasses mais un peu molles . Par contre l ' air climatisé est tres fort . . .
Pizza was ok . Nothing great nothing terrible . We were shopping at the Safeway since we ' re visiting and stopped in for a bit . Ehh
It is hard to find and the outside is not well lite . The carts are all outside in the parking lot nothing in the store .
Mediocre and expensive as taqeria go . Normally I would have more to write but there ' s just nothing more to say . I won ' t be back .
Pricey for their size . Only good if you work near Liberty Village . Otherwise there ' s better option on Atlantic Avenue . They do takeout .
Decent restaurant , wasn ' t that impressed with the food . . . bland for my taste service was above average
Staff was great , felt for the 2 ladies , there were a couple of ' real ' phone princess ' s here tonight . . chicken was good , $ 15 . 50 pricey for dark meat .
Really lovely atmosphere and delicious food but extremely slow service & difficult to get a hold of your server
If you like being served by model - types in little black dresses , then this is the place for you . The food ' s not bad either .
I ' ve had better pizza but it ' s quaint and good place to eat when you are visit the Linq or going on The High Roller .
disappointing . the burgers aren ' t worth the price
Haven ' t been to jack n the box in a while . Bonus jack is on special . No big deal . It was ok . But they have my strawberry fanta .
I liked the idea , but i got the shrimp and it wasn ' t the greatest . I think trying the hamburger may be a better idea next time .
This was a recommendation from a friend which got mixed reviews from our table . My husband was not a fan but my daughter & I really liked the lettuce wraps .
I am knocking a star for the over priced food . It is good , but nothing special . Most things can be made non spicy
Tilapia Veracruz is one of their best items on the menu . But I feel it is overpriced . Good to go in groups .
Food was pretty tasty and service was on par . Free Wifi to boot . Nothing special but if you are looking to get the job done while getting your job done , it works .
Nice hole in the wall sandwich shop . Very reasonable prices .
Great service , excellent cheese cake , however bone - in ribeye was just ok . Good sized cooked medium but there was no sizzle and the steak was not hot .
This is the first place we hit to have our lunch as soon as we arrived at Vegas . Decent chinese food . Ma pao tofu was a little too soft and not much spicy .
Seems small compared to the Vegas location , but has the usual parrothead vibe .
Great food . Service is great ( Cathy ) , but a place like this - - creating a high - end appearance - - should have cloth napkins .
The service is very friendly , but the food was a little disappointing . Prosciutto was thick and near jerky - like . Pizza was bland .
Pizza was alright . I still rather go to Pizza hut . Good cocktail selection . TVs with sports channels like ESPN to watch .
Tasty tacos but terrible service . We ordered 2 additional tortillas as soon as our food came , but they never brought the additional tortillas . How difficult is it to bring 2 tortillas extra ?
Decent , good for pre - game or pre - activity drinking , but not if you are looking for authentic Mexican food
Pretty solid place for dumplings in Montrel . Had pork and lamb dumplings that were pretty tasty and standard fare .
The food was delicious ! The the service took more than an hour . . . . it wasn ' t even busy . I even saw a couple walk out for taking too damn long .
Not busy and food just ok . Sat at the bar and the bartender not good with service . Not knowledgeable on the menu .
Food is just fine . The amount of prostitution going on during the day is alarming . Jesus help these women .
Just ok . Lots of beer to choose from . Burgers to small for the bun size . Sides were good . Price was fair . Service was just ok . Will add more later . . .
Had lovely apps like the spring rolls but the sushi left me wanting more . . . not as fresh as I would expect .
Pretty cool place , gets really crowded though but overall dope club . Drinks are expensive though and free popcorn was given out dont know if thats a regular thing .
Good food , friendly staff . We stopped in for dinner and enjoyed the ragu . I love cheesecake but found the parmigiana cheesecake a bit strange for my tastes , but hey it is Italian !
Lunch with the Missus - too cold for the patio . Darn ! Nice seafood pasta with great sauce and a nice veal Parma sandwich .
Good gelato place , but lacks traditional Italian flavors that I ' ve grown to expect from a gelato place . Very friendly staff and the location is nice , too .
I have only been here twice to get breakfast . Service was very fast . Crossian - wiches were good ok .
It ' s now Red , White and Blue Bar and grill . But this is my first time here and it seems like and awsome place ! The beer is very good !
Service is very good ! ! Food is okay , tastes mild and could be lot better . Not spicy at all !
Well paying for an under cooked lobster at $ 88 dollars didn ' t sit well with me but I did enjoy the duck n Mongolian beef
Good won ton min but hardly any seats for big parties 6 or more .
Cracker Barrel does not question anyone with pets entering the restaurant . Only service animals are allowed in food establishments . Willful neglect of law and customers .
The beers I ' ve had seem to always fall short . The food has too much going on for a brewery . They either need to commit to being a brewery or being a restaurant .
I love potbellys but for the price the sandwiches are small . Back in Chicago the potbelly sandwiches are bigger ? Or at least I don ' t ever remember them being that small ? ! ?
It ' s a decent technical trail . Hardest part is coming down . It ' ll look like 10 ways to get down but only 2 are right .
Fantastic Thai Tea ! The food is only ok . The service was relatively quick . Hard to visit during peak times because of the lack of parking .
Enjoy the food and the place was very nice but a bit overpriced . Overall it was a good experience . I loved their bread ! !
It ' s normally really good food , but unfortunately we don ' t frequent it because of their low sanitation score . Sorry .
Good food , fast and easy for kids . Best hot and sour soup . I recommend this place for a quick bite to eat .
I like Burger King breakfast and their vanilla coffee . However , this morning I opened my bacon croissant to a big black hair coming out of it . Make it right bk , make it right .
Its a starbucks . . . . . . they are pretty much all the same . Only bonus is that is close to Spanish Hills so not a major drive .
Appears to be CLOSED . Phone number not in service . Went by last week & was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building .
Grand VIEW - that just about sums it up . The only other thing worth mentioning is the price .
Decent sushi , decent service but not as good as the Cote Des Neiges Sushi Plus location . Go to that one instead !
The flavor was there for the Hainanese Chicken Rice , but felt like I got more bones than actual chicken meat . Cloud ear mushrooms salad tasted OK nothing special .
Nice little joint . They serve your traditional korean fare , but with better ingredients .
came here for drinks . it was an older crowd . we always walk by and the patio is solidly packed every time .
A cut above your average airport restaurant - fantastic salads and colorful menu ! I ' d love to try their other locations .
This is a good local bar . The wings were average and they had a good beer special with 3 dollar Coronas on Wednesday .
Had a decent meal here . Friends enjoyed escargot , Server was friendly and was happy that we didn ' t split the check . Nice place to have a light meal with a date .
Went here for drinks . Didn ' t have any food . Drinks were good and on the high end of " moderately priced " . Ambiance was nice .
Good place for food the workers just have no respect always wanna talk back they always Ina rush
Kohl ' s is a great store when it comes to value . The store on Valley Verde is enormous and right off the 215 East . Nice staff Great Value Name Brands
Good location , I like that they serve wine and spirits different than the other locations .
Was disappointed to have soggy tortillas for my tacos and soggy nachos from there Pico de gallo . I had to ask for replacement tacos definitely not going back . Roberto ' s is way better ! ! !
It was just okay . . . the girl was using the same gloves preparing the food and handling money .
The food is so - so , but the waitress with the blond spikey hair is amazing . I wish I could remember her name . . . She could be one of the best in Phoenix .
The food here was ok . The service was great . I will recommend It if you are in the area looking for a quick bite
Food tastes good , but portions could be bigger for the fare . Wait staff was very good and professional . We were able to sit right down which is not common for a Friday night .
Poor service . Gelato selection is very large and good quality . Dont get the coffee though .
Big portions , good sauce , cool atmosphere ! Right on the strip and it ' s got a bull to ride ! Got the Cowboys burger and I ' m stuffed ! I would eat here again .
This is a cool place to hang out and drink beer , but the food has gone downhill considerably since opening a few years back . Average food at best . Good beer list .
Fun atmosphere if you want to people watch from the outside seating area . Beer is cold and food is typical for bar . Staff is average , location good , price is what to expect in Vegas .
# 304 w / chicken was great as was the red curry w / tofu . Wine costs about same as an entree so water might be the preferred beverage .
A fine choice if you ' re staying in the hotel . Kids menu ; daily drink specials . Nothing special but certainly acceptable .
Well . . They did say they were sending a few gift cards out for my mother but we never received any .
The selection is deeper than the hole that it is gonna blow in your wallet . Really really really really needs a kids size
This restaurant has good and authentic Persian food . I find the rice to be a bit heavy and easily filling but the meats especially the koubiddeh are all very good .
I am all about the Dill Pickle POPPED , but five bucks is a bit dramatic . Nahmean ?
Great patio and location ( if you work in the financial district ) . Lame beer selection though .
Very friendly service . All you can eat is reasonably priced . Spicy tuna roll is just a little too spicy
Despite their description , they do not install RO systems that were purchased from someone else . Guy who answered the phone immediately said RO system I purchased was no good and I should buy one from them .
Their phone number doesn ' t even work , so don ' t even try to call in .
A little expensive for what you get , especially since the kids pack no longer comes with a reese ' s ! ! !
Service - outstanding , decor - nice , sangria - OK , food - mediocre . Nothing terrible , but nothing memorable or " authentic " either . Typical chain restaurant : - /
The food was alright ! Nothing that I would write home about . The server was nice and it was a really beautiful setting .
Tried this place because it was close to home . . The pho was just average . Nothing special
Huge inventory of outdoors stuff . Great fishing gear selection .
We bet it all on red . And lost . Bad luck aside , this Horseshoe is clean , lively , and centrally - located .
The place is a little noisy and the menu options seemed a bit plain , but the service was great and the food was decent .
It ' s fancy and has great service . Too bad the ramen was so bland . I like their pork Baos though . Otherwise I will stick to Tampopo ' s ( in Tempe ) Ramen !
Ordered 6 little asada tacos to go took forever to get waited at least 30 mins . Tacos were just okay nothing special
Gyro was pretty good . I decided to order the one with Feta cheese . Way to much salty cheese and sauce . Staff was awesome and friendly .
This placed closed a while ago ! When they were open , they had great happy hour hurricanes and deep fried pickles ! Regular menu seemed overly pricey . Oh well . . . gone now !
Went for crawfish but they were out . Had a shrimp PO Boy sandwich and it was good . My gf had the spiced shrimp and it was great .
Nice clean place . Staff is trying to be very helpful but it seems strategically understaffed for the traffic here in downtown Summerlin
Although I like the food , what really bothers me is how crowded this restaurant always is and how slow and inattentive the waiters are . I expect better service for this prices on the menu .
The women who work the counter are the rudest people I ' ve ever encountered in a small establishment . I guess they have so much business they don ' t care to lose customers .
Typical asian buffet , nothing against . They got their chef for " Work " station . You can put anything inside with different sauce that you like .
Pretty small portions . Might be enough for a lightweight eater . Greek fries was fries with feta on top . . . . yawn
I like the tatami table ! The food is ok , just any kinds of sushi boats , udon , and fish .
Good sports bar . Lots of TV ' s bacon cheese fries were good
great and original ambiance with decent soups and good coffee . Although the chai tea lattes are not drinkable and the sandwiches are only good if you like cream cheese .
Not amazing . Just " fine " Focused on high volume sacrificing quality . Prime Rib was underseasoned .
Restaurants could be better . And down a concourse or so would be nice . Security lines arent bad either .
Excellent surgeon . Poor bedside manner . One day a week office hours . Waiting room packed . Dirty . Needs a paint job . Small . But again , his surgery was excellent .
Pretty good food , albeit weirdly dry . I had the tilapia taco , which I do not recommend . Service was good though !
Can ' t beat the pizza ! Darn good and you can buy by the slice to mix it up .
Decent vegetarian food . Makes me dream about the shuttered Veggie Long Life restaurant that used to be on East Flamingo .
Good pizza , kids love this place , no real healthy options . Cesar with chicken was overdressed
The waiter was not very attentive not helpful . My food was ok but I drove out from the strip and was a little disappointed . I will try another place before returning
It was ok . Expensive compared I other places . Average Food & took a long time at the bar .
I ' ll stick to the Guero in Tucson . Tried to come here twice and both times they were out of ingredients and the alternatives I got were just ok .
It was my first time there . I had their fried rice , and it was okay . They put too much butter on their rice . The sushi was good , but not best .
good food , but the cashier guy needs to learn english . . . . he screws up the order 1 / 2 of the time !
I ' m just gonna make it short this time and say love drinking here , do not love eating here . Great outdoor patio !
It ' s fast food . . . . Need I say more ? Points for serving breakfast all day . I only go for $ 1 large diet cokes .
Food eh . Place filthy . Bland Pho . I pray the kitchen was cleaner the the actual restaurant . Will NEVER return . Disgusted .
Typical bar and grill type place . The beer is cheap , the people are rowdy and it often gets pretty packed . There are always a lot of young people here which gets annoying !
For the food we had it was just OK . Burger could have had more seasoning to give more taste , instead , it was just blend .
Got a nice fade but was shocked at the price of $ 22 . No barber cut is worth more than $ 15 . Sorry , I won ' t be back .
I enjoyed the experience very much . The mechanical bull was fun to watch people fall off . The food was good for a BBQ and reasonable priced . If you like BBQ and enjoy western theme stop by
Pretty good bbq but it ' s the sauce ' s that make it better .
Very close to W Charleston campus of CSN . Very convenient location . Pricing of gas is relatively same as any other gas station in the area . Thank goodness for Techron .
Quality has gone downhill recently . I used to love this place and came here once a week , but two of my coworkers have gotten really sick after eating here .
Came here for Father ' s Day around 8 : 30pm decore was beautiful not doubt BUT service + food quality + price was terrible .
Checked this spot out while in town : Service could have been better The food is good Large portions Vegetarian options Margaritas are good Good
Good food , good service . I loved the chicken colorado . Management seems to be interested in how to customers feel which is always a good sign .
Food was good but they didn ' t take credit cards so I had to withdraw cash at the ATM inside the bar and pay a $ 3 fee for it .
open 24 / 7 . Typical snub high school kids as employees but who cares ! They make bomb smoothies . Try the peanut paradise .
This is a chain , so don ' t expect somthing fresh , flavorful or in any way unique or exotic . That said , I like their Buffalo chicken burgers .
I come here for drinks and chips / salsa . The tacos are a bit gimmicky and lackluster . Fun environment though .
This place is really cleaning up ! It is getting better thanks to all the funding being pumped into downtown . I will keep checking back to see improvements .
Good , wisconsin - esque experience . The flavors of the day , mint oreo , then cookie dough , were just ok . Would go back , unless I found someplace better .
They NEVER say " Thank You " to the customer for their order . I ' ll never understand why management doesn ' t correct this .
I LOVE the product , but it takes so long to get your order that I ' ve been late getting back to work .
Went back and had a better experience . But , there are still a lot of things that could / shoudl be improved .
Went to this restaurant by paradise valley mall . Have huge tortillas and a very nice looking menu .
The meat is really good . But sides are all bland . I would go back if I was craving BBQ food , but only to eat shredded chicken or pork , not the sides .
My linguine entree was soggy and buttery in taste . Very disappointed . Apple pie dessert was superb .
Pizza was okay , but really greasy ! Not the timeliest either . Wings sauce was decent but it was clearly cooked in pizza oven .
The food is just ok for the prices . Seems to be more focused on presentation than serving size and flavor . Great view of the lake and upscale dining .
Needs improvement . First time I ' ve had salsa without any kick at all that my seven - month - old agreed .
Everytime I go here , the produce is wilted and wouldn ' t last by time I got it home . Only good thing here is that they have a good variety of bulk stuff . Meh .
tastes like the honey pig in LA . it ' s really busy and the kbbq was nothing special . I wish the fried rice was less soggy and more crispy .
I think cakes are little bit expensive . Staff made a coffee too much in a cup . It was difficult to bring it out soon .
Just not good for a $ 500 dinner . . clients from Chicago were excited and very let down and the waitress was rude and short answered . .
I had the Sammy shrimp and it was good . sit outside closest to the strip under a heat lamp and watch the craziness while you eat . Great entertainment .
in contrast to other art galleries in big cities , Toronto has much to be desired . AGO is a great event space , but the arts . . . more for les $ please .
Last resource for fast food , but did not deliver , 3 stars for costumer service 0 food .
I used to drive 45 min to get this classic bit of Americana and now there is one two minutes from the house . My arteries are in trouble . . .
Atmosphere is ok and clean . Had tacos today ( Tuesday ) . It was alright , not great . Sauce is too watered down . Lack flavor . Over all i give it 3 stars
Friendly staff . Good Irish brews and food . Had breakfast here with a friend . The sausage with the bangers and mash was excellent . I had the lox which was pretty great too
Egg rolls didnt taste fresh . . . . the pho soup had a little bit of sweetness . . . It was okay but it wasnt my taste !
Decent Bahn Mi . Fresh spring rolls were not very good . Bread is fresh but they really really skimp on the meat . Cash only . This place has a line and be prepared to wait .
I had the jalapeño pimento cheese burger and it was OK , nothing really special though . The fries were a bit over cooked and I did not enjoy them .
Good driver to airport . Still want uber back in Reno
Decided to try Gilley ' s for dinner . Ordered the brisket sandwich not impressed due to the dryness . Probably won ' t be back with all the other options in the area .
Prices are good food is tasty but service is usually slow go a lot for lunch here . Friendly service but watch your silverware make sure it ' s washed thoroughly have complained numerous times .
Terrible margaritas ! We paid $ 11 for watery , salty drinks . Totally not worth the money . The food and service were excellent . Will definitely come back , but will order a beer next time .
New rolls are the best . Especially the coriander sauce . Can ' t get enough of them . I always order extra sauce and eat it with everything .
Good food but a little too loud for conversations . But still . . . good food A little waiting is required as they are slammed . So don ' t come here extremely hungry .
Definitely not bad ; not really good either . It ' s nice that the garlic knots are complementary and pretty good . Nice discounts offered . Will not be back .
Friendly staff , they keep the lines going . They also keep the store clean and well - stocked . TjX Rewards card ( not credit card ) is worth it to get bonuses , benefits .
A small and cozy coffee shop . The service is quick , and the shop ( including the milk / sugar counter ) is clean .
Great service , easy location but mediocre boba . And I have had my fair share of boba . The cups are awkward to hold and I couldn ' t move past it .
Egg drop soup is terrible . Worst I ' ve ever had . Tastes like water and egg whites . The chow mein , fried rice , and sweet and sour chicken were ok .
Not a bad beer list . Pizza was thin crust , but really felt like it was not freshly made and it was not great .
The lemon shortbread was wonderful ! Soft and just a bit more than a " hint " of lemon . The flavor was perfect ! I would eat the shortbread any time !
Place is real nice and the service is good but you pay a lot for average food . Nothing to excite you except the cornbread which is a must have .
Homey décor , friendly staff , decent prices . A nice throwback Greek family - run restaurant .
So so bagel sandwiches . Not worth going out of way for . Flavours mediocre . Packed to the brim , definitely not worth waiting for .
Great service but not as good as other burgers . Thin and possibly frozen . Two poor girl baskets and drinks 25 . 00 . Not making a special trip here .
Service was slow , granted we are there at 1am and at least we could get a drink and some food . The chicken was good . Breakfast was average .
Exactly what I was looking for in a 24hr cafe . Decent food anytime of the day . I had a Ruben , my friend had an omelet . Both were great .
School has nice facility , instructors are very knowledgeable . I wish they will offer classes longer instead of booth camp .
My second choice next to the Marriott next door . Nice rooms good service and tepid customer service .
Spent a Saturday night here drinking - loved the vibe and all the retro decor . The drinks were ok , tiny bit weak - I liked it more for the friendly , easy going crowd
Spent a couple days here waiting . . . . waiting . . . and finally they bought their new car . The salesman was nice and patient . A nice two day visit to their car lot .
There are two redeeming graces for this Las Vegas casino : its has a great view of the Turnberry Suites and it has great restaurants . Other than that , don ' t bother .
Chicken and bacon flatbread was excellent . Raspberry lemonade smoothie was mostly ice and almost no flavor .
It was ok . Nothing special maybe a little overhyped . It ' s really not that hard to make fish tacos at home .
The food was actually really good , but the strange complete lack of service and dining - hall decor really detracts from the experience .
Drinks are very good and the crab cakes . Everything else was so so . PROS : Ambiance , service , drinks , crab cakes CONS : pricey , food is average
Spicy chicken Friendly staff ( not sure if sarcastic ) Nice hot sauce Mash potatoes are yes . I bought the second spiciest hot sauce and it ' s not that spicy . Imagine sriracha but spicier .
The pizza is always good , but when management allows them to reuse coasters to the point of them being moldy on the table , it makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is .
The mani lasted for a week . no chips , and no cuticle rips . what a lovely deal . will be going back .
Clean . I admit they got the best kimchi soup . But the quality of the meat wasn ' t all that best .
The chicken waffles were a bit cold , potatoes were great though . Overall it was okay .
Good for a quiet lunch . The wedge is decent . The patio is nice and prices are reasonable . For dinner , the downtown location has better food and atmosphere .
Great at what they do , absolutely horrible customer service . Have to be a regular / favorite to get your hair cut on time even if you have an " appointment " .
I had this a couple weeks ago late at night , it wasn ' t bad for $ 8 for an XL with ground beef . The fact that it is 24 hours is always a good thing .
Ordered a cake from here and it was really tasty but they totally upsold me on a cake twice the size of what I actually needed . Really expensive . And the service is not the greatest .
Waitress needs improvement , waitress made four trips to take our order and still forgot what we ordered overall the food was good . A lot of employees doing nothing
Beeeeer ! I don ' t remember this place . I guess mission accomplished .
I was there over the weekend . The food was good and so was the atmosphere . The wait staff seemed to be annoyed with their job .
Decent pizza . The crust was kind of bland but the cheese and sauce are great . The large is actually more of a medium .
Great exhibit and well thought about . Lots of great descriptions and artifacts . Staff were very eager to point out some surprising hidden gems and even some insider knowledge .
Service was good and staff friendly , but the burger was sloppy and the fries over cooked . Nice convenient spot .
I stayed here for one night for my flight was cancel . The breakfast was OK at the restaurant .
super sweet staff . I had the soup and it was very good . I think though you might want to try the fried chicken , I heard it was super good . Cornbread was amazing
Went on Monday for fajita night . Guacamole was awesome , but fajitas were just ok . We had good service and enjoyed walking around Grand Pacific Junction afterward .
Caffeine & gambling . . . . . . mmmmm Located inside the MGM casino so you can stay up later and what else " roll the dice "
Got a cabana with buds at the pool for the pre Jimmy Buffett party . Was definitely worth it !
It ' s just fine . Nothing special , but nothing great .
This place is great to come to for a late night dinner after a nite out . The food is okay and the service is decent .
Probably one of the best places we hit on the strip . Good service and decent food . Value for dollar and yelp scored us a free drink .
The greens are the best we had . But the rest of the food was mediocre to okay . The fried chicken want seasoned . The biscuits were terribly dry . The craft beer list was excellent .
Nigiri and roll sizes are awesome . Quality is not what others have said . It ' s not the best and it doesn ' t come close to great . It ' s alright .
Love the Italian gold wings . Pasta was good this time too ! Ac was not working well so super hot . Really rough for the kids
Big fan of the pho . Not so much of the hibachi . Nothing wrong with it , I just don ' t like hibachi very much . Mad busy , but quick service during lunch .
the food lacked a bit of flavor but the surrounding decor was nice and enjoyable . i would go back . but my husband wasn ' t pleased .
It was alright . A little expensive for my liking . I think the food would have been better if I would have went there to eat instead of having it delivered to my home .
Food is good for the price . Wait staff could use some improvement on refilling drinks . Soft drinks are overpriced at $ 2 . 50
It was fresh ! But I felt alittle odd until the owner came out then the atmosphere hanged for the better !
Most of their food is really good . However I do not like there pizza at all . Their garlic knots are probably the best I ' ve ever had !
I did not expect sauteed garoupa to come in " cum " sauce . But the fried chicken was tasty .
Food is average , nothing special . Muffins are good . $ 3 . 29 for coffee and iced tea a little pricey . BOGO coupons are helpful .
I have been coming here for over a year . It ' s not the greatest pizza but it is very good for a I don ' t feel like cooking let ' s get pizza
Much cleaner and inviting than the other location . Coffee is kept warm . Can ' t beat walking downtown . Does a breakfast right bottom line .
Family style dining . Friendly servers except for the Italian guy . Big groups of people will feel comfortable here . Not expensive . Large portions . Unimaginative food
Menu and ambience are good , but food was just ok . Was a little expensive for what you got .
We had a family dinner here . The food was fine but a bit overpriced . Nice dessert selection and the service was good .
This not stand out for me 雪山火焰包 叉燒餐包 , 越嚟越差 . I like the 潮州粉果 , 皮薄餡新鮮花生仲脆 Better services quality . 煲粥 有蛋殼 . 食物品質 , 即叫即做 溫度好 .
I love the remodel , and it being close to me , but it seems that only creeps shop here . Prices are generally average . The beer and wine selection is pretty good generally .
Server was friendly , but this time , she was sweeping right under us as we were eating ! Hardly checked on us , had to wave her down a few times . Food good .
Cash only was a little disappointing . The baked goods are great and well risen , and the desserts were ok but the doughnuts were incredible .
We ordered 3 fresh banana shakes & a few food items . Unfortunately our shakes were super watery . I wouldn ' t recommend buying shakes here .
Great ambiance but okay food ! The onion rings were delicious but everything else we ordered was subpar . However , the the decor is gorgeous and very unique .
The turkey sandwich was good but not worth the price at all . . . The watermelon drink was horrible ! ! ! ! Not impressed with this place at all . . . Waste of money
Good - same as Pho Hung , Double 8 and Peach Garden .
Sharp Edge means great beers and this place does not dissapoint . The food is pricy and not worth it . Go for the amazing beers .
Ok food , nothing to wrote home about . Friendly staff clean atmosphere just want impressed enough to go back .
Great Mexican food , not so great service . They were really understaffed and it took forever to get in on a Monday night .
This was an okay choice for a quick and inexpensive meal . Nothing great and some of the chicken was a little tough . But it was tasty and filling .
Over promise and under deliver . They ' re resting on their laurels . Save your money and eat at somewhere with better food .
The ambiance is nice and dimly lit . I also really enjoy their cucumber drink . However , the food is good , but not worth the prices .
It was good . the food tasted good especially the original bibimbap and yukgejang . You get free macaron ice cream when you leave a review .
It ' s a Chili ' s . Food is consistant with the others & clean . Go for happy hours to save some moolah .
This is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars . Nice ambiance and pretty good food . Ribs ( sweet ) , mac and cheese , and fried okra were my faves .
Our second time having a beer and snack . Was just ok . Our host gave us the opinion she wanted to be somewhere else . The waiter was friendly and helpful and attentive . Beer was ok .
Ice cream was good . There aren ' t too many old school ice cream parlors anymore that serve just the basics .
Tried the Chicken on the Rocks & Stix ( half & half ) - with two lines of hot sauce , it was super filling - enough for almost two people !
Taste is mediocre depends if you prefer quality or quantity food . If you like quantity over quality , you will like their wonton .
Pretty average ice cream . The said , you drop extra Reeses Cups in dirt it would taste good .
Kaiten ! ! ! Don ' t understand why this has a 4 rating , I understand . We have different taste ! Friendly staff reason why I gave 3 . Will never return ! ! !
Not sure about the food but arrived at 11 : 21 Saturday night and they were closed . Posted hours state 12 .
DONT let them place you on hold . Assuming you want to talk to someone within the next ten minutes or so . . .
Food is good and quality of ingredients are great . Service is not good . Basically removed two stars because of the poor service
Good late night drunk food . I would say if you are coming any other time ; I would choose another place .
Great for students in terms of hours and delivery availabilities , and a sufficient amount of selection so long as you are in the mood for hot and greasy food . Pretty standard drunk food and pretty reliable too
I would have to say the food is not bad . I ' m from Hawaii and have tasted better Ahi but the crab cakes was good .
Not enough exercise mat . People are very rude there ! Not enough classes for healthy back ! It ' s really going down
For is good very hit and miss on certain items . Service has really gotten bad . Gone here for years but I think servers have gotten too relaxed in their jobs
Decent food . Our waiter was very friendly . Initially they brought out all of our food very cold but apologized profusely and rushed to bring us out new ( hot ) orders .
An average mall with all the usual stores , quite light and bright and spacious . Nothing special in terms of designer shopping which is disappointing as its the largest mall in Toronto .
Fast . Friendly . Efficient staff . Boston Cream . Wild , Wild , West - Charlotte .
Been here about three times to get some bubble tea . Drinks are really good . Atmosphere really anoyinng . And drinks last really thirst quinching . Wont be back for a while .
The salad and hush puppies are great , but everything else is very greasy . It was just ok .
Looks are deceiving . The pizza was great the hot peppers were nice and hot The sausage was spicy and infused with a gentle fennel flavour . One of the better pizza joints I ' ve been to .
I only stopped here briefly for a drink while trying to find lost family members at New York New York . Expensive but a cool place and a nice server .
Clean , Close to the hospital . Nice Gazebo .
Tried shake shack because I heard the burgers were good . I ' m in the search for great burger joints . Theirs was just a little bit above average . Not bad . Franco out
Overall cool concept , wide range of flavor selections , but the tapiocas were way to hard / undercooked .
They allow the Mom ' s to bring their kids to the bar ? ? ? ? I guess if you say something it would be worse , smh .
First time at Corrado ' s . Loved it . The food was delicious . The portions were very generous . We will definitely be back .
Service bien et rapide . Ambiance générale dans le resto agréable . Un peu cher pour les plats adultes par contre menu enfant abordable moins de 5 $
Carpet was nice to stand on but it was so hot in there !
It is a good restaurant in general . The service is excellent but the food isn ' t . It ' s a bit too salty in my opinion .
Somewhat overrated - service was very slow to order a drink and then dinner . Food was good , not great . Lobster was chewy , steak was good . Caters to tourists and large parties .
Great juice however the girl behind the counter was extremely rude . Obviously wanted to be somewhere else . It was a Friday afternoon . Not busy . 4 pm July 27 .
First time going to the Scaborough YMCA . Right now they have a free 2 week trial membership .
The donuts are good . The coffee tastes like urine . That is why I give this place a three star .
Great beer selection . Food is tasty , but nothing to write home about . Getting a seat can be a problem during lunch or dinner time particularly on weekends .
Thie food here is more Asian fusion than Thai . Great service and summer rolls . drunken noodles a bit too salty and I love salt .
This could be a really nice gym but often the weights are all over the place and there ' s usually quite a few pieces of broken equipment .
I hate how they make you sit at a table with strangers . So awkward . The veggie dumplings were yummy though . Everything else was just okay .
Food was decent , service was terrible . What kind of sushi restaurant serves sushi without wasabi ? Let ' s just say this place is far from authentic !
Chef ' s food is excellent . Poor servers who don ' t know how to serve dim sum mar the experience . Tea pot overflowing and a hostess with Scarborough kitchen - side manner not cool .
The food was OK but having tried a lot of the other Greek food in the area I definitely think there are better options
Excellent food . They keep the place uncomfortably cold . Tuesday taco night is packed with low class clientele .
This place is changed its not namsate veg . We found flavors little bland . We ate dabeli and chicken biryani . Dabeli was good but chicken biryani was ok .
Good " college " type bar downtown . Cheap prices and lots of sports tvs .
Service was very good . Atmosphere relaxing . Food tasty and reasonably priced . Located conveniently by Symphony Hall .
Had The 8 " big John . Rare Roast Beef was very good , lettuce was cold in the sandwich good amount of mayo , not Their best sandwich , altogether .
I travel through the city and shop at many European deli shop but the cold cuts prices at La Salumeria are absolutely ridiculous !
It tastes really good but in a Friday night it took one hour for us to get our food . Be prepared to wait a LOT .
Lunch buffet 11 . Piping Hot fresh nan . home style . 2 apps including meat samosas and 6 main choices .
Interesting menu . Drinks way over priced . Bone in pork belly was ok . Not enough to eat $ 12 vodka . Would go back to try something else H
Stopped in for lunch . Nothing really worth noting at this subway . Very small , sparse meat on sandwiches . Friendly staff .
The food is VERY good ! Everything else is pretty disappointing . Uninspired decor , not very many tvs , oddball seating arrangement etc . But the food is VERY good !
It was $ 14 . 00 round trip but dang it took almost an hour to get picked up outside & loaded . We will see if the return is any better .
This is a substitution food place , just sub for the homemade food , that you can ' t get at the moment , there frozen entree food taste better then , inside restaurant food .
Nasty vinegar . . . not sure if it ' s like that at other locations . Service was always good at this location tho .
The decor is nice . It suggests that the coffee would be good . Unfortunately my americano was very diluted . Watery . Better than a chain but the coffee is disappointing in this coffee shop
Maybe I am not a pizza person . Had a couple of friends highly recommend this place . Tried once , ok but nothing stood out .
Outdoor seating feels like your in Key West . Good , solid Caribbean food , happy hour starts again at 9 : 00 , reasonable prices , good drinks .
It is what it is . I am never disappointed , and never blown away . I have been to this location three or four times .
Good Dim Sum but validation for parking didn ' t work had to pay 12 . 00 to park .
Food was flavorful and not too spicy . A little light on the serving than what I am used to . Favorite dish was the spicy eggplant with chicken .
Didn ' t get a chance to have there food But the 3 star is because I called to put in an order and was told it would be 45 minutes to complete the order WTF Ridiculous
Very disappointed that they are no longer selling their cinnamon rolls . They were the main reason I drove to this side of town for breakfast !
Pedicure was amazing , manicure not so much . The nail tech was really distracted and rushed through the process . They were short staffed so it ' s understandable . May try again at an earlier hour .
It was fine . The salon and atmosphere are a bit ragtag and not comfortable . Haircut was good . The presentation is rough though .
Nice and clean store . A little difficult to get to . I found the chicken to be fatty when I ordered it for several visits .
My first time experience here was ok . . . Was expecting better . Some meat it wasn ' t marinated so was very blant side and meat was too thick n chewy .
It ' s about as good as it gets in Calgary ! Don ' t expect too much and definitely do not compare it with clubs in Montreal or Toronto or Europe . . .
Why must you take my money . The casino was decent and the drink people came around pretty regularly . Unfortunately the black jack dealers are just too good and always won . What gives ?
Solid snack bar fare in a good people watching spot downtown , also conveniently located next to the GN ' s sports book .
Visited this Yonge & St . Claire spot mid week for lunch . Service was good , food was pretty average . A decent spot for lunch if you ' re in to seafood .
This place has gotten better over a year . The service is very good . The food is not bad . Few of my friend insist of coming here a few time .
This place is just ok . Nothing special . Marginally decent bar food . Had a pizza because I was was the most appealing item on the menu . Again , just ok .
Just ok - ambiance was lacking but food was great . They were able to seat a large group of us last minute so I appreciated that .
I live two blocks from the mall so it ' s easily within walking distance . It ' s a good size mall with a variety stores for everyone . You won ' t be disappointed .
Awfully loud inside during dinner time , service wasn ' t very fast , food was decent but nothing to write home about . Overall pretty mediocre experience
Overall place is overrated and average . We were a group of 20 people and the overall opinion was average . Service was slow .
Super annoying how everything is put away a half an hour before closing . After racing there from work ( because they close at six ) there is nothing left behind the counter . Good meat though .
was alright , had better . there is a lot of variety , many in which were very unique . Atmosphere is welcoming , and people were very friendly : )
Kind of pricy although good . Wait staff from Israel provided superb service ! Nice patio .
Tried the food because it was something I had never had before ! It was ok , big portions , worth the price . NOT wheelchair accessible all the way to the ordering counter !
Meh . Place is ok , nothing to write home about . Drink prices fluctuate like the stock market which is also Meh . Service was average . Much better than Martini Ranch though .
Update ! 3 - 31 - 16 , Big sanitation issues , they were shut down by the health department for three days . March 25 - 28 , 2016 .
The place looked cool until the host who looked cracked out and washed out performer opened his mouth ! He ruined dinner . The food was good but I won ' t be coming back .
Burger was good and tasty , if a tad over cooked . Fries were unspectacular . Enjoyed sitting outside . Good place for a quick bite on the strip .
Classic greasy dinner food . Try Cafe on the Strip for better Italian french toast and shorter line .
Floor and restrooms not clean . Playground too difficult for a two - three year old but good for 5 - 6 year old .
Nachos are an enormous portion and delicious . This spot features a ton of TVs for watching the big game and space to hang outside . The margaritas were pretty tasty and happy hour begins at 3 daily .
The swim program is awesome . I love Erin . She is the best coach . The gymnastic program is just okay . I see a lot of older kids leave to other gyms .
Dinner was very expensive and full . I have to admit the atmosphere is good and it looks classy . The inside looks nothing like the old wasabi . : )
Good place to eat . I liked the pizza and the chicken wings ! Good family meal deal . This is better quality then Papa Johns , Pizza Hut or Dominos
The whole place was average . I thought the food was very plain and the atmosphere was not as fun as Tommy Bahama would portray .
Pizza was graded a B . Wings were D - as they were over cooked and tough in the middle around the bone
Over priced and food quality is not good . Not worth going again . The plating and the place itself look fancy but the service and the food don ' t really go well with the price .
The food was good but the waiter over sold the dish . It was good but the way the waiter talked about the food was over rated .
I am sad that the fantastic sandwiches and soup from before are now gone . The food was ok but not outstanding .
my panini tasted better cold later than warm at the restaurant . the salad was better than expected but nothing special .
souper les fins de semaine bon mais extrement bruyant . Buffet dejeuner a eviter ( je n y suis alle qu une seule fois au dejeuner ) .
The atmosphere at this location is great , and we had a good time exploring the options on tap , but o would love to see more variety offered from the brewery and better service
Decent and cheap haircut with friendly stylists . They cut me a little shorter than I would have liked but pretty good for $ 14 .
Okay . Too much dressing on salad . The yellow tail roll was good . The yellow tail sashimi sliced very thin
Décor enivrant ! Service personnalisée , sans compte l ' expérience gastronomique exquise !
The guacamole was good , my husband loved his quesadilla . I don ' t remember what I ate , I would have to say that the guacamole must have made me forget : )
Nothing spectacular . Went here for lunch one day since I work nearby . Food was for me but the place was packed loud and cramped . Next time I would go takeout . Prices seemed about average .
I was so disappointed when my cup came out with caramel all over the outside . I asked the barista to wipe it and it still was messy .
Pretty good , but some machines are always broken and instead of putting signs up , they wait for you to ruin your evening with nasty watery yogurt in your cup .
Very small rooms but nice and clean . They do have good breakfast . The only complaint would be the the stink of smoking in the lobby and the floor I stayed in .
I ' ve been on the hut for the chicken and waffle chips . . . . . I just knew seven elven would have them ! Well I was disappointed ! They didn ' t have any !
Disappointing meal . The fish had way too much batter and the clam chowder was just ok . The old Avenue Bar restaurant had much better food .
No wifi ? ? ? Only 2 TVs at bar . Smoked salmon salad $ 12 was very good .
Great juke box , cheap beer makes this an ok neighborhood bar . Not sure why everybody loves this place . There are much better bars in Charlotte . David
Too big in size . Like the idea of Mexican Asian fusion . Noodles in a burrito is good but beans don ' t match with it . Hot sauce is good .
Never actually made it in . The location on yelp is incorrect . This Starbucks is inside of Target based on another person ' s review .
The tea is good but the food was kind of bland . It had all the right ideas but it didn ' t translate on the plate .
Food was good , and is a nice clean place , however the decor is very touristy and not very local to Hawaii
The services here are alright . The installation person makes mistakes and you have to go back and do a price adjustment .
Pizza is great , however they seem to have hiccups with online orders . I had ordered online but when I went in to pick my order up , they didn ' t have it in their system .
It was a cool enviroment in here before the club started . They got a dress code in here thats pretty strict . Its a decent place to chill . What more can i say ?
Have to say I ' ve ordered from this place several times . The wings are DELICIOUS . The pizza was OK . Not enough sauce on there for my liking , but my husband absolutely loved it .
This is a nothing special steak house . I had their signature dish - - bone - in dry - aged NY strip . It was ok but by no means memorable .
bomb ass food , horrible service though
This store is doesn ' t have a lot of selection . Parking looks kinda dangerous at night .
Location is solid but the room was dated and slightly smelled like smoke . Also had some issues with the water pressure for the shower . Location is very close to the strip and linq .
Meh Would I come back maybe just for the atmosphere but the food is just ok - I ' m always shocked when ppl say they like their food
It was ok . Nothing special . We ordered the Rocky Balboa to go . . . it ' s been 35 mins . It should not take that long to cook a burger ! !
Small Airport , not bad to get around in , but not a whole lot to write home about . There is a decent food court and a smaller pub in terminal A .
Decent espresso , good selection of drinks & food , friendly staff , priced a tad higher than other places . Great place to get some work done .
Grew up near this Starbucks ! I ' m so glad they made a bigger location where the old Taco Bell was and now with a drive thru !
the food tasted good , but a bit pricey for what it was . The service was good . The environment was good .
What you ' d expect out of a bar on Carson . Decent food and a good selection of brews . Service was good .
love the food and atmosphere at hh , but for the love of god , turn on the mother fucking air conditioning !
Classic - need to get the bologna sandwich , and the soda isn ' t bad either !
Good but a tad expensive . I only purchased two cartons of fried rice for a party . Bland and boring .
This was a decent place to chill & get drinks , too bad its gone now . I had to add the late review just so I can add to the list lol
Good location in Arcadia but very average on food . We had several side dishes including Mac and cheese . The meats were cooked too long and were dry .
I like the fact that they have healthy alternatives and they are close to where I live , however the food was kinda bland and very messy .
We used the come her a lot and the food was amazing . From my knowledge , there ' s a new owner and food has been getting a little sloppy .
Had brisket with burnt ends , very dry they did have a good viniger sauce . Would look for another BBQ restaurant if in the mood for brisket .
Very nice place great noodles but the pizza was ok . The pizza made me feel a little uneasy but overall decent place buttered noodles are actually like the scoops and not the long noodle but not bad .
This place was good for Charlotte . They did spicy and naan very well . I would come back after I have tried other clt restaurants !
モールとカジノに隣接、素晴らしい立地のホテル。高層階から見える夜景は絶景、その分お値段は高め。部屋はきれいで、簡単なキッチンもついているので、モールで美味しいものを買って、部屋でも楽しめるのがお勧め。ただ部屋のWifiの電波が弱く、データ受信が遅いため、改善されると嬉しい。
I was just not that impressed with the sandwiches . I would rather buy the baguette they make there ( the kids enjoy watching that ) and make my own sandwiches at home .
Ordered Filet Mignon , veggies and garlic mash curbside pickup on 3 / 21 / 2011 . It was good , not quite great . Service for pickup was excellent .
It was the best choice in the food court . Pretty bland though . . . . . and pricey .
Fun place ! Great big screens for all games . Pour a good cocktail . Food is bar food solid . Great staff of waitresses are personable and efficient . I will be back again next time !
Good good for a grab and go lunch . . I ' d like to see what dinner would be like . Friendly staff and pretty fast with the orders
The food was good but they have no idea how to make a margarita on the rocks . Tasted like water . Might have been tequila in it , but there was no flavor .
I expected a lot from this restaurant . I ' m a little disappointed because it turned out to be not the fantastic sushi restaurant I thought it would be . Very ordinary sushi dishes . Nothing spectacular
Food is good however service is slow . Still waiting for my bill . Also the ambiance isn ' t anything special . But I would come back for the food .
Avoid all you can eat gnocchi night unless you want to overload in super starchy carbs . Not a lot of flavour . Not worth the money .
Cheap , casual , edible , always a line up out the door . Lunch specials before 5pm . No complaints . Fast food .
Nothing special , french fries are really good Lot of regulars If you want a burger and fries worth visiting
Acceptable Thai food . Maybe it ' s good for Toronto but not seeing why this place got such high reviews . Food was not that great but decent enough to eat . Got the Pad See Ew .
Turns out my cousin was charged twice for the room . We got it straightened out but what a hassle . Glad other Yelpers are getting a pleasant experience out of it .
The food here is really good but the service isn ' t that great and the drinks are overpriced with barely any alcohol in them .
two ice machines in the whole freakin hotel ? ! ? ! ? ! ! one on the 5th floor and one on the 50th ! ! wth ? not at these rates ! !
Ordered the samurai pad tie , vegetable tempura , and yellow curry . All three are very good . This is a solid place . If we lived in the delivery area we would order food often .
the girls are nice ! They don ' t get down and dirty . Not the best looking girls but at 12am they will do .
Good place to drink and watch the game . . . . the wings are good everything else is just ok .
A small shop with a decent selection of fabrics . Prices were about average . Lots of great notions though .
The good : Lobster Caesar offers an exotic twist on the familiar drink and really hits the spot . The bad : portions are small and leave you feeling hungry .
The place was clean , great service , great foods . My bf ordered chicken fried rice and they put too much onions that it overpowered the flavors . Other than that we would come again .
Nice cozy place , old style feel with oldies music . Food is edible Very kind servers but service seems to be slow for large groups a good place to get a warm quick meal .
Love planet fitness ! The 3 stars are for the location equipment and size . The missing 2 stars are due to the fact that the staff needs training in customer service . Friendliness will grow your business .
Went there cause it ' s at work place and I got appointment quickly . My appointment was around 3 : 15 . Dr was in a rush
I ordered the waffle fries with a blue cheese burger . Burger was ok , but fries extremely salty . Nice service nice atmosphere .
The juice was great , tad pricey like basically everyone else has said but hey if your sick or coming down with something great place to stop by !
Service was ok and selection was ok . I ended up at Pandoras Purse in Chandler and found alot more selection and Rosie @ p . p . really made me feel comfortable .
Well the sign shows Shabu Grill but they don ' t grill anymore . According to the server it ' s been gone quite awhile .
Atmosphere was nice . Service was good . Server told us about the drinks happy hour . Food was decent . I would come back to eat here .
Wasn ' t that busy . Sucks that there is only one elevator which you have to go back to every time if you have a stroller .
Totally different concept . Completely new thing for me was you can choose your cook who will prepare your food . I picked not one of the bests ' . My cook messed my food . sorry .
Seriously should be half the price what they are charging . A meat plate for $ 14 . 50 that was mostly rice ? Is everybody that rich ? ? ? ? ?
Food was great and the employees were great . No free beverage refills though . I was hoping id get a little more pork also .
Happy hour deal is good and lasts until 7 and starts again at 10 . Quality is mediocre , but good for half price .
Good but a little pricey for the quality of the food . Atmosphere good .
Good food but takes too long before game to get order , be sure to come early , 35 mins to get food .
The Silk Road is great : spicy with a unique flavor and great after taste / bite . Skip the pork dumplings , they just aren ' t interesting or worth it .
It was quite good but 12 . 00 for an omelette no toast or side was a little shocking . The staff was friendly manager was quite serious and not a lot of smiles .
I liked it but high prices for portion sizes . Some of the sauces were not great . Sugarcane is a better option at the Venetian .
Please correct your store hours . We came by tonight at 6 : 30 and found you had closed at 5 : 00 !
asked for two beds , they gave me one bed . but it ' s fine , the pool is so small and ugly though lmfaoooo
Long wait for a burger that was not worth it , plus fries are extra . . . the noise level was ridiculous , will not be returning
Just average . Nothing special . Deep fried spring rolls are fishy and the pho was salty .
Great live band and appreciative crowd on Thursdays for Latin Night - but no room to dance .
Nice comic books store , not very friendly but have a variety of back issues .
They have good pizza but , most of Thier food with exception to the pasta and salad , is pre - prepared ! Service is good . Tom Dean Hudson , Ohio
Is this place still open ? Grungy biker bar , from what i remember . Good live blues , tough looking hombres , and ice cold brews . Far from fancy , but it was definitely interesting !
It ' s a good place to get chinese , hawaiian plate lunch , and sushi . Prices aren ' t too bad .
Would have been five stars if the massage was better . I do really like this place , but why is it that when you spring for a gel pedi the massage is barely anything
Style pseudo - italien chic pour travailleurs du secteur financier de Toronto : agréable , menu varié , très bon service mais bruyant et pas forcément le plus confortable . C ' est pratique essentiellement .
Solid spot for AYCE . Not mind blowing . The fish was ok ( too much rice ) . Enjoyed the appetizers the most .
This place is just okay . We sat at the bar and the bartender was great ! Food , however , mediocre . Decent bar food .
Good food overall the service can improve personally expectations met but the other table had a misorder . Overall average dining experience . Love the thai iced tea and chowmein
There was only one server butttt she was working the place big ups to her ! ! ! !
Mediocre food , service was great . Unfortunately I don ' t come for the service , but for the food .
Alright , pizza is nothing special , but this store has a nasty smell to it , like something is rotten . Smells like fish and grey water . . .
Service seems to always be an issue when we come here . The menu is limited for vegetarian options , but it is still one of the better brunch places in the area .
Stick with the seafood . Tried the sirloin on waitress recommendation . Very disappointed . . good flavor but way too much fat
Excellent customer service though little pricy but fast and quick response . Though some of the Mr Lube doesn ' t do all type of service for cars , still overall I am satisfied and recommend it .
First time at this restaurant as a first date with my boyfriend ! Great soup and perfect amount of pho ! Definitely coming back !
Queen location is better beside trinity bellwoods . If you ' re in a jam for their product it ' s a good place to pick up . Better vibe and feel at original store 3 / 5 *
Got the gnocchi for dinner . Found it to be dry , overdone and overpriced . The elderberry drink I got here was yummy but I won ' t be coming back for it .
Food was good here , nothing that blew me away mind you . The service was very lacking . Our waiter was none existent . The iced tea came served with simple syrup , a nice touch .
Bar area is really crowded given the location next to the stadium , food was good .
Between Fairmount and st . Viateur , I guess I ' m in the Fairmount , . I do have to say that I prefer the New York bagels over the Montreal Bagels .
Food is good , but a la carte so no fries with those burgers . Also , if you are from UNLV , they no longer take Rebel Cash . Milkshakes are good and thick .
Decent breakfast and lunch spot . Grill cheese had no cheese , just cheese fried in the bread . Odd . Off to try other breakfast places , the hunt continues . . .
Housekeeping department needs attention . I did not get my coffee today !
The restaurant was nice , but the food was nothing special , nor was the service or the atmosphere . The place seemed like your average cafe .
The gentleman who cleaned my carpets was awesome , courteous and nice ! But I think the price was way too high . . and I apparently got a discount . $ 120 to clean 1 room . .
Very large and spacious restaurant with nice decor . Portions were large . Food was decent . Kind of weird that customers eat fast food style ( no wait staff ) since Afghan Cuisine is not fast food .
Views are great . Beer selection great . Food barely above local tavern food . Fish and chips were oily . Burger was dry .
This is our first time visiting since they changed locations . The food was excellent as always , however the service was really slow . It took over 30 minutes to get our food .
$ 22 pedicure . Usually a wait . Not a huge selection of polishes . Clean , good massage and they color within the lines . Solid 3 stars .
Good ' cheap ' eats for Vegas . I ' m a lover of tex - mex and rock n ' roll ! Mmm . . . chips and salsa .
Food is ok , not a big fan but I know my friends like it a ton . Grilled cheese is pretty decent !
very loud better to sit outside and enjoy this place
Love the atmosphere , location , and soy lattes , but the service is subpar . Try their fresh baked cookies ; crispy corners and soft - gooey insides , just the way I like it .
Pretty good shrimp , egg , leek dumpling ! Mai xiang yuan is more juicy and better though ! !
Pretty cool place for the kids , they just forgot one important thing to their venue ! The baby changing station . A family place like this needs one .
rooms are okay . spacey . kinda dim . pool was nasty . . . they need to clean em more often !
I got the Fresh Mango with Sago Mixed . Honestly , it was a great first few bites but overall the taste was average . Really wish I had gotten the fries instead - they looked AMAZING !
Bagels are great , service can be iffy , coffee is WEAK ! If only there coffee was good , this place would be a 4 star plus .
Not bad , but really doesn ' t deserve the crazy high ratings people give it . It ' s a cool place to have a few pints , but the food is mediocre .
Service was great . Group of six ; we were seated and served quickly . Reasonable prices , great drink scpecials . Food was fine .
Just an average burger . Maybe my expectations were too high after reading reviews . Very disappointed ! Found them to be tasteless !
Fast , convenient , and decent food . The staff are quick and friendly . Great for a Wednesday night meal .
Meals are affordable but the quality is just ok was expecting more from a Thai restaurant
Needs a better DJ and more promotional events . Nice chill place and great date night but is not meeting its full potential .
Great donuts , best bearclaw I ' ve had in a while . However their hours are very confusing and they are not always open when their hours claim to be .
High prices don ' t match average tasting dishes . Service was adequate but food came at staggered intervals . Best dish was perhaps the Chicken Curry , which tasted much like the curry my mom makes .
I have been here a few times . Food here is quite salty before but I see lots of improvement this time . Service is ok only .
Food was okay . Not a big fan for the price point . I liked the Japanese whisky selection . However wished the food was better .
I didn ' t spend much time at the hotel but the air conditioner was terrible and I could hear everyone who was outside .
garlic fries for 4 . 99 is a rip off , pork belly is good but a bit too sweet , pho is amazing , pork chop rice is good but steam rice is too hard
I arrived this morning from Honolulu we waited on the plane for 15 minutes until the delta gate crew finally got it stuff together then waited another 25 minutes to get our bags come on Cleveland do better
Be aware of their weekend parking rate . If you don ' t have rewards they charge you $ 25 . 00 and we were only there for an hour . Yikes !
It ' s fast food , not amazing , but good .
Tried the happy hour thought it was pretty good . The prices were unbelievable and the food quality was alright . ( Hard to please when you re spoilt by fresh seafood ) . Def worth checking it out
Food was good , atmosphere is cool . It ' s a little pricey , and not a good place to take your lunch break . Lol . Make sure you have time to take it all in .
I have been here a few times now . Over all for a fast food type of place it is good . However , watch the protein as it has been over cooked on a few occasions .
We just left the restaurant . The food was good but the people behind the counter were very abrupt and a little rude . Makes you not want to go back .
Food was good . Service sucked . As many people said , the wait staff did now know what the food was . Also , they forgot to give us things we picked .
We had chicken papusas - - not much chicken in the papusas . The masa was too grainy . The salsa was not spicy - - not much flavor . We probably won ' t go there again .
Food is good service is great , and if you ' re friendly a person , it ' s a good place to eat alone . Lots of regular that ' s lookong for good conversation .
格式高いホテルのステーキハウスに来てみました！ nice view！！ベラジオの有名な噴水を見ながらのディナー 目の前が噴水でとっても良い席を用意してもらえました〜。 そんなにお腹は空いていなかったので軽くオーダー。 appetizerはoyster こっちのoysterのsourceは美味しい サラダはシーザーサラダ これはもう定番！！量も丁度よくて良かったです。 メインディッシュはsteak！！ フィレとリブがミックスされてるボーンsteak。 これを綺麗に切り分けてきて貰えました。 さすが格式高いベラジオのレストランは接客も最高ですね ミディアムレアでオーダー！柔らかくて美味しい ( * ^ ^ * ) ドリンクは乾杯はsparkling！ その後はナパヴァレーの赤ワインをボトルで。 とてもステキな時間が過ごせました〜！ 美味しかったです！
Portions are big and price is good . Wait staff can be a little frustrating to deal with . The actual pics of the food need to be updated as they are hard to view .
I thought they had some unique artwork here . I got a nice painting for a reasonable price . The staff was pleasurable .
The veggie hotdogs were decent but not great . The veg toppings were better than the dog itself .
The curry dishes were quite good for the price . I had the mango curry with tofu . Good size portion and I had some to take home . Only wish brown rice was an option .
Pretzel bites were really fresh even in the middle of the afternoon , check this place out for a quick snack .
Received lovely service . The food was okay that day , not its best . Really nice to eat lunch on the patio .
Great location in old town . Not the most warm welcome , but the coffee was fabulous ! Had the cappucinno and sister had tea . Tea had the loose leaves .
excellent location nice decor and lighting food was good and fresh only downfall was the filthy unisex washrooms wait staff , unfriendly but that ' s typical of Asian restaurants .
Come for the Thursday trivia , stay for the bar fights . Reasonably priced rotating Great Lakes tap is also a plus .
Friendly service but the car wash doesn ' t wash very well , at least they let me go through a second time . Gave them an extra star for being nice .
Tried the Kangaroo sausage . Pretty good , with a side of duck fries . Pretty pricey place for a sausage and beer 30 $ Kind of confusing beer menu , but cool atmosphere .
Fun night out with friends . Typical bar food and good environment - watched some Olympics . Waitress could have been a little more friendly - saying that service was still good .
Still clean and fresh ! Just disappointed that with the lunch dish there were only 4 small pieces of meat .
Food was OK but not great . Wall to wall 20 - somethings appearing to be dating and connecting with friends .
Pour une petite bouffe mexicaine rapide et pas trop cher ! Quelques produits sans gluten et plusieurs cocktails assez particuliers qui ne manquent pas d ' acool !
Excellent selection and convenient location . Food was served a little slow ( 25 min ) but decent quality .
Wasn ' t too impressed with this buffet . We went because we had the 2 / 1 coupons but even with that it wasn ' t really worth it .
Nice place but you have to wait for a long time to get your order . Lemon mint drink is refreshing and their Shisha is good
The service is friendly . The food is average and bland , served in giant quantities . The Bloody Mary was the highlight of flavors .
Not bad for chain - restaurant type Mexican . Portions are big . Service was good . I ' d come back
Pork belly tacos are to die for ! Wait took forever and host staff was a little rude , but I ' ll be back for the food and atmosphere .
Really good . Downtown indie feel in Scarborough . Come here once in a while mom and pop operation . So you know the food is good .
Like to go here only for Indian vegetables , spinach which are fresh and few groceries . Am hater of frozen things so no comments on that .
Just opened , food was fresh , and the employees are new but very helpful and courteous . You get a good amount of food for your money .
Good . The hummus was really good . Close to Homemade . Not enough lamb flavor in the meat . Perhaps more mutton is needed . Good value .
Really love their Passionfruit and Earl Grey macaroons . I ' ve had macaroons when I was in Paris and I must say I find Ruelo ' s passionfruit and earl grey macaroons are way better .
Fun and chill spot , good clean room with stereo , fridge . Long line for checking in so be prepared , but good spot .
Food is decent , nice courtyard . The employees are all very friendly , except Helen , Helen is a terrible human being .
Food diversity is great and it ' s kinda yum but I don ' t think the environment is good .
Tried the seafood pasta ( forget name ) and it was terrible and for $ 22 the price is ridiculous . The staff seem friendly and the decor is very nice but blegh .
Location and ambiance are great so it ' s unfortunate the food isn ' t great . Tried several items on the menu and all were blah .
Is pretty cool I like it . . . Is really romantic and is hidden place then why don ' t 5 star because is smell bad there and a lot of mosquitoes . . .
Average Chinese takeout please temper those five star reviews . . . The food is typical mediocre to good and there is absolutely nothing special on the menu
This place has very good nihari and kabab ' s and nan ' s are hood as well . Overall this place has really good food but they really need to improve bbq chicken
Not impressed at all . Very slow service , no sense of urgency in staff . Mediocre flavor in ribeye . You can get much better steak in flamings or mastros .
Decent food , the milkshakes were pretty awesome . Super slow service though even after the long wait for our table to be cleared . Their build your own burger was cool .
Thank you for your response to my review . I ' m glad you are looking into why no one was at the door , and the doors were locked in the theatre . Thanks for responding
Had a groupon and so that made the prices good . The problem I have is that paying that much for a drink I really think you should have glass glasses vs . plastic .
Nachos were good , macaroni was ok , burger just ok . I would definitely pick delux over here for a burger . . . Pricy drinks too . I don ' t get all the hype .
Good food . Mild and regular salsa served w chips . Large variety of margaritas . Standard ( Americanized ) Mexican dishes .
Cheap breakfasts but they get you with the beverages ! Steak was dry and scary looking . Eggs and hash browns were good !
Aj is awesome chef and amazing at taking orders , by far clean and great prices . Will be going back , however , the wings were very oily ! So no to wings .
Hi actually I just want someone to confirm their rate of $ 99 per hour thanks .
Trendy restaurant in downtown . It was nice to grab a bite to eat and a beer on the patio in the heart of Downtown PHX . A little pricey but they have a good happy hour .
Food was good , service could be a little bit more . on point , will definitely come back .
The casino should be made smoke free and safer for innocent non smokers . It has affected kids too
Can you believe that they don ' t serve onion bagels here ? It blows my mind ! Everything else about this location is the same as any other Einsteins . Service is sometimes great and sometimes average .
This place was good , but just good . Happy hour sucks bad and the sushi rolls could be bigger for the price you are paying but over all the sushi was very good .
We went to this place on Sunday morning for brunch . Service was friendly but slow . It took us long to be seated although it was not busy . Food was ok and coffee was descent .
I am disappointed that they do not have ceramic cups . Espresso . drinks are ruined in paper . The macchiato was not bad .
Cold fries . Nothing was spectacular , but the bread was the highlight . Goat cheese / jalapeño was greasy . We only had brunch , perhaps dinner would be better .
The Drake has great Brunch and very good service . The coffee on the other hand is awful . Do yourself a favor and order a beverage other than coffee and you should be fine : )
Good . Food was fine . Beer was fine . Music really loud at the dinner hour . Service was exceptional . The service alone is 6 stars out of 5 . Solid final meal in Montreal .
If not for the occasionally terrible customer service , this place is a dream come true . But why are people who work in dessert places always so miserable ?
Usual good food and entertainment and usual poor customer service . Seems to never improve . Food arrived before drinks and forced to pay before finished eating .
Magasin bien éclairé avec des tablettes pleines . Service amical et rapide aux caisses malgré la folie des fêtes .
Place is ok if you want to buy moonshine . I couldn ' t believe they do not have bud select there . Prices are a little higher than grocery store .
Nice interior with great food and good service . Expect the place to get busy on the lunch rush
Thanks for reassurance but that isn ' t what I experienced . Also , water should be adjusted before placing my feet in bowl .
I am one that likes it . The scallops wrapped bacon are the best .
decent , had to check it out as I have heard great things on Sully ' s from neighbors . serve and food wad middle of the road .
Great place in a nice area . Thank God the omelete wasnt runny and they have heart healthy options but some great hearty breakfast too . My spouse had the meatloaf sliders and they were great !
Cosmo was sour . Service slow for airport & food soso . I love Chelsea ' s in Phoenix . Less than happy here .
Hit and miss but overall pretty good . The service is often lacking but the food is so darn good we still make a visit every so often . The teriyaki chicken is a must try .
This place is good , but it is nothing special . It is also rather expensive compared to most sushi places I have ever been so this rating is a result of a bad cost / quality ratio .
This was just okay . I ' ve had way better . Nothing special .
Yeah BOGO great but had BETTER be BOGO with those small sushi rolls for that price ! ! Nice , cute , man - bun waiter .
Disappointed for a high end place . This was our second time at this las vegas location . Both time disappointed
Not too bad . Got the meatball sub . Nothing really making me fiend to come back tho . Overall 3 stars for the complimentary soft serve .
They have a pretty nice buffet . I go for lunch usually . Good service . Reasonable prices . Good selection . All in all it ' s worth a try !
Formule gagnante boisson et pizza , pas pire pizza mince , j ' ai bien aimé . Terrasse et boisson servies sur pots massons comme la rue .
Very reasonable pricing . I got a 90 minute massage for $ 57 . The massage experience was very average . It does not compare to the resort experience at the major hotels but overall it passes .
Saturday service for dining late afternoon was very slow . Waitress was inattentive . Food was standard WI bar food and just okay .
Good quality products , but hate the upsell . Always spent one to two hundred dollars , but came in for a simple oil change . Advice : change the oil yourself for half the cost .
The staff was awesome , but the food definitely should have been better for the prices . Our salmon was overcooked and my long island came out tasting like a margarita . I expected better .
Overall . We enjoy it . The experience has been hit and miss depending on the menu item . Service is good . We have had enough good experience to keep coming back .
Good BBQ sauce and tender meat ribs are awesome and so is the brisket ! I come back 1 - 2 times a month for family dinners
Astonishing in its mediocrity . I had chicken with orzo and a couple of margaritas . Nice / pleasant / utterly average .
Rock Bottom Brewery has closed its doors in Cleveland !
went there for the first time . had a good time . and good services too . it is a cool little dive bar and does not pretend to be something else .
This was a celebration type dinner for myself , my fiancee , and my future in - laws . Quite pricey for what they ' re serving , but everyone really liked what they ordered .
Dissapointed with the portion sizes . Pretentious ! Meet wasn ' t tender . Nice place , DJ , and good atmosphere .
The food was good but it is not children friendly . No kids menu nor simple apple juice .
Good kalbi , bulgogi , and choice of 3 banchan ( side dishes , like kimchi ) . What else could you want ? Mmm . . . . .
The burgers were tasty but not much beef on the bun and the tomatoes were bland . The fries were absolutely not fresh cut and were quite difficult to chew .
They are good & fast . The line gets backed up , but moves pretty well at lunch . No wifi : - (
Well , it was okay . But really I won ' t be back . Service staff was excellent and very friendly . Just expected way more with those prices ! !
Fairly decent coffee with empanadas . The atmosphere is nice They have many hand made Mexican goods for sale .
Food is pretty good . Service is nothing to get excited about . They have free poker on Tuesday nights which is a lot of fun . It ' s a nice laid back sports bar .
I was not overly impressed with the food . It was ok , but I would not go back again . Spending that kind of money , i would rather go downtown to another Izakaya
Went for brunch . Service was good & food wasn ' t bad . Would I crave it & go out of my way to go back ? No .
Def one of my fav places to stop by in Scottsdale . Bartenders arent that great tho , VERY stingy with the alcohol .
Awesome place to watch the Cowboys game . Chicken tenders too bland , no flavor . But liked the fresh tempura batter . Just need more flavor .
not really great for late night AYCE but the food was great overall although a la carte pricing is kinda expensive
Love the tortillas ( one of my favorite ) but the food consistency needs to be worked out .
This place used to be very good with putting our orders in , but now I can ask for the sashimi 3 times before it comes , I think they cheapout and dont give away the expensive stuff
Solid Italian place if you ' re ever in the area .
This dog park is heavily used . The water feature for water dogs is really cool but it does not seem like people pick up after their dogs much . Boo , lots of poo !
Meh . Some good dishes . Nice salad to start . Pad Thai is not great . Just noodles , egg and whatever meat . No veg . No crunch .
Food was good ! It took a pretty long time to come out but I think only 1 cook was on duty so I ' m sure that was the reason .
It ' s pretty good ! Nice caesars , decent lobster roll and the whale tail is pretty fun . Not super cheap , but good .
It ' s a decent enough place to stay if you ' re popping into Vegas on a spontaneous turn around trip . Clean rooms . Friendly staff . 4 . 5 miles away from the strip .
Décor historique , bonne nourriture , prix abordable . Le Problème est toujours le même : le service . Ça fait 4 ans que je connais l ' endroit et rien n ' a changé .
Burgers are alright . . . . nothing special . The onion rings r huge . . . delish
Great tasting Wings ! But godawful greasy !
We had a pretty good meal there . We had worked late and just needed a bite to eat . Unfortunately the place was hopping and the service was very lacking . But the food was very nice .
Good standard sandwiches and helpful staff . The place seems clean and well maintained
Vaste choix des produits internationaux , russe , arabe etc etc , fromages , charcuterie , terrasse disponible pour manger sur place les plats preparés du jour .
Tasty food . . . but avoid the anemic and overpriced taco salad that would be better priced at $ 1 . 99 rather than $ 6 . 99 .
The food is good , but they take forever to serve the food , a big turn off for such a nice place .
Great prices , but a total c - fuk of a mess . We ' ll be going to the Mills location .
Food good . Coconut shrimp and cod . Waiter sucks and trying to get out of here before the band starts back . She is so off key I can ' t believe it .
Place is cool . . needs a bit more vibe music . . but is clean and has great cigars ! all men should stop by ! !
My expectations was too much perhaps , I was not satisfied with my meal , Mabe it was one off does nights , will try the shawarma sandwich next time
It ' s pretty good stuff , but it ' s no pinkberry that ' s for sure . I have become addicted to frozen yogurt over the past months so this will have to suffice .
They do not accept Discover card . They also do Not honor military discount ! " You will pay the full $ 14 ! " ; ) The legroom is nice . . .
Service was great and food was just ok . We just got back from new Orleans so we were disappointed with the food here
Nice little place . We did not buy anything , because I saw way too many nuts on items and my son is allergic to nuts . If you love dark chocolate , this is your place .
Good food and reasonably priced . The corn tortillas were great and I liked my margarita . The decor was awesome . I ' d definitely go back if I was at the Hard Rock .
Good truffle fries Mac and cheese was the bomb Lamb burger was ok Service was awesome Relaxed and cool atmosphere
Salade excellente et bon dessert , malheureusement le service laissait à désirer : une seule serveuse pour tout le restaurant en pleine après midi ensoleillée . Débordée . . .
Chicken taste weird and my wings were hard AF nothing like a California locations didn ' t really eat my food or finish it threw it away and shared some with the dogs
Wouldn ' t suggest the food ( had the artichoke dip that had the consistency of paste ) , but dude ! The drinks are amazing ! ! !
Open 24 hours is great ! Great dessert and I love Chicken Waldorf Wrap . However the staff is weird and off standish .
The sandwiches are great and the staff is friendly , but the place is absolutely filthy . Your feet stick to the floor and the tables are dirty . Would strongly recommend a TO GO order .
Pretty good . Service is typically below average and the kitchen is slow , but there is rarely a wait to be seated and the food is yummy .
It ' s Panda Express , starch , some kind of dead thing , sauce , possibly a vegetable mixed in . This one is no better or worse than any other .
Staff is great . Service is great . I don ' t recommend the fish and chips . Fish is not the typical beer battered and very bland , no flavor .
I just popped in to see what selection of iPhone 4 bumpers they had . Is was moderately impressed , but the prices were a little higher than I wanted to pay .
One of the few Wolfgang Puck restaurants to ever disappoint me . Not that it was bad , but it just wasn ' t as good as I expect from a Puck place .
Sangria is really good and it is a great place for a happy hour as they have lots of room . The food is okay .
Pizza is good . No customer service . Cold face owener . not very clean . but for 3 . 50 per slice maybe that ' s what you get .
Brisket was awesome juicy and tender . Hush puppies were pretty good too . Selection of sauces a nice treat . Found the pulled pork a little dry .
Amazing menu . High cal Canadiana creativity . But the air in there left me and my clothes smelling like a greasy beaver pelt .
There isn ' t much seating so don ' t plan on staying for hours to do some work . The smoothies seemed better than the juices .
This place has great tacos and dessert . However , they close their kitchen a half an hour before their hours state even for to go orders . The service we had when we dined in was mediocre .
Good , but still just a cupcake , if you need a sweet go to Bosa donuts . . If you need a cupcake do the Pineapple upside down . . .
I really wasn ' t excited about this place . The coffee was fine ( ok I ' m coming from Seattle for context ) . Also their yogurt was watery and literally ran off my spoon .
Average . The nachos were really good but the pork tamales were bland . Just okay . Drinks were overpriced and nothing special but that ' s typical on the strip .
Great breakfast place if you enjoy crying babies and screaming kids . Price is good and the service is decent . I love the pancakes
