10pm on a super bowl Sunday and they ' re already closed ? ? Weak , no wonder the hard Rock is dying off . . .
A margarita in clear plastic dickie cup ? ? ? Wtf ? ? The drunkin shrimp plate should of been called the goldfish feeder shrimp platter . .
The pizza wasn ' t very warm when it arrived ( they didn ' t use the warming bag at time of delivery ) and the order was wrong , but the pizza tasted good .
High price , low quality and bad taste . It ' s not Chinese food nor American food . Don ' t recommend it .
Had a 11 Person dinner there . Service was good , but Everything is over priced compared to quality . All the stakes and meet was over done ( even when sent back to re do ) .
Food taste Ok . I like the pasta selection . However , there is No seafood choices at all . If you are looking for seafood , skip this place .
Our server was very nice and attentive . Margaritas were delicious . But unfortunately the food , no bueno .
I thought Mezes was over - rated . The food is very similar to a bunch of Greek places which are much better value . I thought it was over priced and not all that great .
Ugh ! From hostess , to 15 minutes for a waiter , to mediocre at best food ( flautas were blandly acceptable ) . Don ' t waste your time or money .
It ' s ok . Customer service lacking . Not the " fun " experience its made out to be . It ' s a $ 5 ice cream sandwich . Definitely not worth the trip .
Food is good but they dont let you mix match like bdubs . . . So for that u get two stars bruh
It has slowly but surely gone downhill . Friday night and it ' s empty so I think other people are thinking the same thing . They messed up every dish we ordered .
Empty restaurant at 8pm , bar closing , no chef cooking and absolutely nobody in the restaurant . We made the mistake of staying . Fish restaurant with two choices of fish , but mostly fried . Stay away
If you like the way cake mix from a box tastes then this is the place for you . I felt like I could ' ve easily made these at home .
Slow service . Neglected our table repeatedly . Food came out cold and drinks were delayed by 20 - 30 minutes .
Way over price for the entree . Too much msg ! Got so thirsty afterwards . Sad that we don ' t have a decent pho places in the north Scottsdale area .
Great service and atmosphere . The food and drinks are way overpriced though . If you like your Mexican food mild to bland , this is the place for you .
Subpar food , eggs Benedict was nasty and thick . Consistency was like mayo . Service was so slow , everyone looks like they hate their life . It took forever to get attention for refills on drinks .
Can be better if they put bit more attention to finishing foods and customer needs . . . masala tea is ofcource nor good
Not worth it . My friend and I both felt sick after ordering take out . I suggest going somewhere else . . .
Have to wait about 10 minutes . Mediocre drive - thru service . Something either out of service or they ran out of .
No wifi . Very small , low ceilings . Equipment is very close together .
Mediocre as far as Indian food goes . It ' s relatively more authentic than fast food chains , substantially more expensive , and definitely doesn ' t hit the spot . Very disappointing .
No customer service as the " help " wander around doing nothing . One star for having a greeter that says nothing .
Worst place I ' ve ever been , they don ' t care at all about you . It is badly run and badly organized , just terrible truly terrible
Went here to grub but was disappointed . The Baja chicken rolls were flavorless and the fried pickles were rock hard salt licks . Even their ranch dressing was a solid . lump . Never eating here again .
So disappointed in a floral arrangement I had sent to a funeral . Flowers looked like something you would pick up at a grocery store . I will not use them again .
Food is consistently good here . Portions are adequate , but the service can be slow . The space is tight , and parking can be an issue in lawrenceville .
This place is so small and business is run by dumb ass illegal mf horrible prices better off saving gas and time in the sun to just go but part new never goin there again
In most cases bacon makes everything better . I got bacon cheese potato . They were so dry and bland even the bacon could not make these edible . They went in the trash .
Worst food experience ever . Avoid this place and spend your hard earned money somewhere else .
Terrible Company ! They lie about where you are going to be staying even though they send you out a confirmation . Don ' t believe a word that Louis D ' Amato says !
Started out comparable to Robertos , but has gotten gradually worse . Super nachos barely have any meat on them ! ! I ' d rather make the drive to find Robertos .
We just wanted some McDonalds and when we pulled through they were like " It ' s gonna be a minute " and I just wanted my fries
The service was terrible . The line was 10 deep and employees were moping around like they hated life .
For a place that has " burger " in the title , they sure don ' t serve a good one . I ' ve had better burgers at McDonald ' s !
These people were actually quite rude to us when we were customers . Literally treated us like thieves when we came in to transfer a phone to another .
This location is consistently the slowest location in the southwest area , whether you go inside or use the drive thru . Save yourself the wasted time & frustration .
Americanized Russian food with no alcohol , atmosphere is bland , and service was only okay
I found a piece of glass in my water ! So be careful when coming here . . . The food is ok - it is a little on the salty side .
Do not go here , the place is awful , & the workers are theifs , they steal from cars & blame the customers , Do not go here at all
Huge portion but nothing special . We had the galbi chicken June meat combo that many people raved about . Chicken was too sweet . June meat is boring . The galbi , however , was very good .
The sign says they open at 7am , but apparently they overslept today hahaha . Two stars for sleeping in !
The food is terrible . We tried the dim sum . We were disappointed and overcharged . We won ' t be back .
This place was really bad food was awful my fries were cold . The place was dirty no one table was wiped off .
The b7 I ordered looks / tastes nothing like night market fried chicken tender in Taiwan . Vegetable on the side is over cooked . My friend and I have diarrhea after eating at Phusion Cafe . . .
They ran out of beef . . . . . I came here to specifically try the bulgogi kimchi fries . . . and they ran out of . . . . beef . . . .
i ' d rather go to amado ' s ! the only thing that ' s good here is the bean dip , and i ' m only saying that so that i have something nice to say .
So slow ! I ' m an ex - employee , these girls were so incompetent it was driving me nuts .
Extremely rude coworkers ! ! Prices are overly too much ! They don ' t accept cash AND you have to buy tartar sauce too ? Are you kiddn me ? Never AGAIN coming back ! !
Just waited 25 minutes for an ok burger and chewy fries . No apology , no explanation . No reason to do that again .
Pizza is pure garbage . But what do you expect for $ 5 ? ? ? Was not " Hot and Ready " when I walked in .
Came in and order at 3 . 16 pm waited for 30 mins . Still haven ' t gotten our order . Hopefully next time when I come bavk , we might get better service .
Fedex sucks so hard that they hand off our deliveries to the USPS . What was the point in using FedEx in the first damn place .
Second time in and again I wait for a Ready Now plain ole cheese pizza ! I need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers !
10 min wait for table . They got my co - worker ' s order wrong . Nice view of the planes taking off and landing .
Stay away . Over exaggerates and nit - picks using his limited knowledge .
I would give them zero stars if I could . Terrible experience with reception and parking staff .
Horrible food , worse music , inattentive staff and overpriced drinks . No wonder they closed .
Worst Mexican food that I ' ve ever had . Ever . I have no other words to describe it . I would not recommend this place to anyone .
Une attente de 45 minutes et des œufs bénédictines pas assez cuits et un café qui goûtait l ' eau .
I had a small veggie burrito from burrito boys for the first time . It tasted good but the service and the way the burrito was wrapped was poorly done and sloppy .
Jerry Nowland no longer runs this company . Please ignore reviews before 2017 .
Not like my neighborhood Manuels . This place was cold , the service was sparse , and the food was horrible . Stay away .
Horrible service . Rude people . Please don ' t waist your time and money going to this place .
Blah . . . The service was poor the food was average and the place reeks of bleach water . . . I won ' t come back .
This over weight cook is according to the " M " resort in Las Vegas has been DISALLOWED on their property since 2010 for declining public interest in her Martini time show .
Left me in waiting room for 45 minutes , forgot I was there , had 5 minute interview because I had to get back to work and said they would call me , never did .
I go to Starbucks almost every day this is second time I have encountered rude staff and I will definitely NEVER come back at this location . someone should probably look into this . . .
I think I may have broken a tooth on a rock in my mashed potatoes . Service was great but . . . . . . ,
Service was slow . Chili ' s food is bland .
Always understaffed . Tables are wobbly . Long waits for refills . Popular place obviously but they need to hire accordingly .
Horrible staff . Don ' t bother ordering online - they won ' t make it until you get there . Just go to moe ' s down the street
If you cannot read not to leave soliciting trash at my door with this sign , why would I want to use your company ?
It should not take 30 minutes to return a charging cable . . . . you need an express line . A sale with a customer ahead of me took an hour and a half .
Just OK . Had two rooms . Both were marginally acceptable and needed better cleaning . The whole hotel needs updating .
Absolutely terrible service . The waitress ignored us while checking her nails . Drinks are watered down and overpriced . It ' s a 2 drink minimum and the entire place was empty .
Food is delicious but I can ' t leave a positive review here Overpriced and under filling
My order was flooded with chocolate ice cream and it gave me a cavity . Do not recommend going here and this is not a good place to have a birthday party .
It ' s 108 so we stopped for a beer . . The allure of the place is the live music . We came before that . Wasn ' t impressed . .
The service was friendly . The hamburger was greasy and tasteless . The thousand island dressing was too salty . The chili was greasy , and I had to throw it away . I wasted my money here .
My friend and I were treated with total disrespect by a blonde bartender . Will never be back due to her lack of customer service .
Just tried to order two different sandwiches . . . out of both the types of bread I requested . What kind of sandwich place runs out of bread ? ! ? ! ? !
Pho Pros : piping hot , tender meat , hot jalapenos Cons : bland broth , small portion of bean sprouts Service Well , I was the only one there and it was fast and attentive .
TI offers two for one special with limited food to eat and bad service a very disappointment buffet not worth the money .
Worst panera ever . Really dirty . Staff very unfriendly . Not the panera you see on TV advertisements
Slow service and an overwhelmed kitchen . We cancelled 1 / 2 our order after waiting for an hour . They did deliver a pad Thai . Which was over seasoned and a congealed mass of rice noodles .
Way overpriced for okay food . Sorry , I was hoping it would be a new favorite spot but I ' m going to have to pass on this one .
Horrible service . Server put in the wrong order because she didn ' t bother to reconfirm my order at the time of ordering . Food took forever to come and the ramen sucked .
Not worth the price . Service was OK . . . " Poop emoji " " Poop emoji "
The service is horrible , atmosphere is horrible , coffee is horrible , and everything is overpriced . I won ' t be going back .
Stay away from this place . Once the sale has gone through they treat you like a piece of trash .
What is wrong with this place ? Seems like it creates a uproar in the kitchen just ordering a cheesburger ( which I never got ) . I ' ll never go there again .
Had a 7pm reservation but they made a mistake and made reservation night prior . They have had us wait over 1 hour for their mistake and still not seated !
Brewery nachos were good . Teri ' s Cajun pasta was bland and my shrimp & lobster enchiladas were like cardboard ! Bad food . Not a fan ! !
The cashiers are dreadful . Love the food . Hate the service . Ive been several times and the sandwiches are always awesome , it ' s too bad the staff is so rude .
Sad news for Bagel lovers . This place has closed . They are converting to a healthy shake joint . I will always remember the discount bagel rack . Farewell .
Carry out order was literally tossed in the to go box , no sides as ordered with increased price for entree . Not happy and never going there again .
Slow service and more expensive then the usual sushi spot . Lots of people waiting on their dinner and no waitress in sight ! More expensive to eat in then take out .
Average . Fresh but lacks flavor in a major way . Ribeye was 32 $ and it wasn ' t worth it . Won ' t be back unfortunately .
My son had a appointment today at 3 : 30 . Arrived at 3 : 15 had to wait until 4 : 30 to be seen . What a joke Will never go their again .
Don ' t have to come back here . Sushi was terrible . Supposedly tuna ? ? ? Nothing but mush ! Not sure what they mixed it with ? !
It ' s empty but a lot of people visited for a big screen of 2028 fifa World Cup so I can ' t say it ' s empty their food was ok .
Onions onions onions . Ordered a lengua burrito and it was filled with onions . Also ordered shredded beef nachos and there was no meat only onions . Very disappointed .
If you need an internet connection , find another hotel because this wifi is non existent !
Pizza came out cold . We ordered the classic pepperoni and there were probably three slices of pepperoni in the entire pizza . It was just all sauce and cheese .
I just spoke with the manager ( JP ) and he was VERY nice about the whole situation , so I will give Mesa Grill another shot next time I ' m in Vegas .
Stick with Popeye ' s . I ordered fried okras and the quality was not that great . I thought I was chewing on gum . The chicken had tons of fatty parts .
The worst service I have ever had in my life . You need different servers that actually care about your customers . I will not ever be coming back to this bar .
1 . Front desk was rude 2 . Restaurant service was very good 3 . Spa was awful 4 . Location - too far from the strip I expect more from the Trump International Hotel .
Not really impressed , show had it ' s entertaining moments but I guess you have to have a bit of alcohol in your system to enjoy it in it ' s entirety .
The manager would not even show him self . Do not eat there the steak is hard and over priced .
The attendant stopped preparing our order for a customer that just walked in . Not impressed with the donuts and the boba . It tasted like chalk .
This is quite possibly the worst drive - thru . If you have 30 minutes to wait for your fast food to come out , this place is just for you .
the ice cream is great but the owner is very rude . everytime i go in there she always have something rude to say . the ice cream gets 5 stars and the owner gets no stars !
not very professional . The Chinese broccoli has some weird taste and the beet cake has the flour like texture which is not supposed to have .
The food is terrible ! Everything tastes bland , worse than fast food or even canned food . Hope I never have to come here again .
Management refused to let a member of our party in . Absolutely do not go here . Go to another one of the 15 bars on Carson . No reason for the denial of entry .
1st time trying DCS , wont go back . 2 slices of ham does not make a sub .
20 minutes in the drive thru with one car at the window . Ridiculous . We left and went elsewhere .
Not the best place to eat but they do make pretty good green beans ! Do be careful as well because their food gives you the runs !
This location of Tropical Smoothie is always rather incompetent . I would drive to a further one just to have better service and quality of product .
The only good thing about this place is the location . Do not stay here ! ! ! Too much to write about .
BLEH ! Expensive , over - cooked , not great ethnic variety . Yuck . Pick a different Vegas buffet - Try Aria or Rio . You ' ll be glad you did .
Just awful . I had the money chicken sandwich , the sandwich was soggy and the chicken tasted like rubber . The only thing worse than the food was the service . A total waste of money !
This place is not the best . I would travel to chaparral dog park in Scottsdale 30 minutes away before going there ever again .
Scam to up - sale very expensive service . If you don ' t play the game they take your money and spray water everywhere and leave it very wet .
Small and unbalanced fields , ridiculously long wait to rent guns and get balls . Staff is not honest about how long it will take to get on the field .
Burgers are decent but too small and overpriced for what they are . Moo and Brew has better burgers and better value .
Yeah never going here again . The lady was rude . Barely said 5 words to me . It ' s been 3 weeks and my nails are all breaking off . Im so angry
Workers are not friendly , rude and lazy . They care more about gossip among themselves than ring up customers .
Hate this place bad customer service the basketball gym is tiny and it is always packed and everyone hogs the machines .
It ' s a decent playground if you enjoy attractions like heatstroke , broken play sets , and hanging out with the Children of the Corn .
I ' m from LA with local friends and was told this place is amazing . This place had delicious food , but the service was awful . They were all rude . Service is everything to me .
Uber drivers beware the main technician told me he does not like Uber drivers . . if your looking to get a uber inspection go somewhere else
I agree with what Charles G . said . It ' s Friday , we ' ve been here since Monday . . . . pack a lunch .
What is up with the seats in the terminal ? Hard and permanently reclined at the worst possible angle for your back . Probably made in the ' 60s .
When food is just ok , at least you should play the local games on the TV . UNC on one TV in corner while WVU on big screen because staff wants to watch . Pathetic .
omg ! sooo stingy with vegtables ! im never going again my vegtable chop suey was a couple snow peas and 4 baby corns with bean curd !
No bueno . La comida muy mala y me cobraron 8 . 98 por una margarita sin alcohol . No medijieron que no vendian liquor cuando la ordene . Pero vender cervezas .
Service was horrible ! ! Restaurant was VERY dirty ! I eat here 5 - 6 times a month . . . different one over the valley . . . . this has been the worst ! : (
Standing here watching them get everybody order wrong . Waited 6 minutes for 2 sausage muffin no cheese . Yikes
Gone down hill since new owners took over cheese burger Quesada was barely edible wife had chicken tenders with mashed potatoes and chicken gravey which I ' ll call odd colored water mashed potatoes weren ' t edible either
One of the most budget rooms I ' ve ever been to in Toronto . Everything from the intro to the overall experience was completely thoughtless and done with minimal effort . Save your money !
These guys are assholes and the place is filthy . I ' d rather eat frozen Ellio ' s out of the box
The past two time I ' ve come , their ice cream / shake machine is down . Super unfortunate since it ' s summer and 93 degrees outside . . . . .
Went there a few times . Their customer service is horrible . They order the wrong sizes and fail to correct it . Go to another scrub store .
My wife ate here a few hours ago . She now has the WORST case of food poisoning . We will never eat here again !
I would never come back here again . I know all art is open to interpretation and everyone has their thoughts , but everything I saw was completely spooky and made my skin crawl .
Valley ENT did not send a claim to my insurance on time , currently working with them to get this fixed .
What a disaster . We waited 50 minutes for a deep fried spring roll . 1 hour + for two entrees . We were the only diners in there . No plans to return .
What the hell happened to this place , the new menu sucks , the size of servings shrunk , and the quality of the food is uber mediocre . Will not come anymore
Why do I continue to still go here ? Cold fries and didn ' t get the ranch with my Ched ' r peppers and no ketchup I asked for . Is It that difficult ?
Be advised they only have one high chair and one booster seat . If you have multiple babies or toddlers you may want to go somewhere else .
Absolutely the worst drive in . I have never gotten my order correct and you wait a long time for service . I food is definitely overrated .
Yikes ! I just pulled up and they are closed . It ' s only 6 : 10 pm . I was so eager to try a portion of everything too . F me !
The food is an A and the bier an A + , but the service is soooo unorganized it ruins the good parts .
The most disgusting pizza I have ever eaten . Nothing but salt and no cheese . Ugh . . . will never order from them again !
Asked 6 bartenders prices on draft beers . None knew pricing on any of the draft beers . Wholly unacceptable when you are a brew pub .
Neat when first walk in . Then tables are terribly uncomfortable , menu is puny . Food is average at best . Too many other really good places !
Dumbest cashier . Slowest service . Highest prices . Mediocre - est food . Just hoping I don ' t get food poisoning at this point .
Had to get them to wipe the dash they missed the center part and they use very little soap on your vehicle I will not go back
Blah . Tacos and empanadas are not up to par . I would not even compare it to the Filbertos on every corner of Phoenix . Very Americanized tacos , which lacks flavor and spice .
I wouldnt recommend . I work in the area figured I would try them . I will do myself a favor and not return .
All I can say is bad food , there is no such a Indian flavor taste waste of money Don ' t spend ur money
We went for dinner and it was alright . The bruschetta was the best part of the meal ! The pizza was soggy and the quinoa salad was alright .
It ' s good for an afternoon of coffee and deserts but DEFINITELY not a place to have lunch or dinner . I ' ve had better pizza ! ! ! ! !
Overpriced . Small portions . Very Americanized chinese food . One star for the white decor and another star for the goldfish aquarium .
Worst service and managers . Make other plans trust me ! Took 3 times to get a drink right and over 30 minutes
Tried for the first time today . I had he Kung pao chicken it was not that good . The sauce was good but chicken was rubbery
Rude . Tried them a few times . They act like they are doing me a favor whenever I order there .
Bad . The tacos are not good . Cold . Hard . Tortillas were probably out for awhile . I don ' t know what else to say other than save your money and go have tacos elsewhere .
good service , nice ambiance . . . terrible pancakes
Horable service and bad dealings they seem to not have anything right going for them and really don ' t care about what they are doing bad place never again
Any one else having problems booking an appointment after purchasing the Groupon ? I left two messages over a week ago and haven ' t heard back . . . hopefully this wasn ' t a giant scam !
Ordered chips and salsa , took 3 years to get it . They can ' t handle basic service items .
I love Primanti bros , but it says the place closes at 2 am on weekdays when in actuality it ' s 12am . BEWARE
DON ' T plan a wedding at the Palais Royale or any other event for that matter . The coat check staff are thieves and Katarina is horrible .
Classic junk food . It ' s pretty bad . If you want a real burger go up the street to Le Barbare .
Hot as an inferno inside because the giant smokers inside . Dirty nasty bathrooms . Wont be back food was so so .
Horrible service . Food was so so . Sat down waited 10m for menus , another 15m to order , and 15m just to get the check . Never coming here again .
Who ever the guy is that picks up the phone sucks at his job and he works at a phone store so idk I give 0 stars
AC didn ' t work in our room and room smelled like sewage . Pool was good , steak restaurant was good . Won ' t stay there again .
We ordered the white queso , forgot to tell them without hair . . . . It was left on the bill . . . We will not return to this location .
Tried to have breakfast at Over Easy but after a 40 minute wait and cold food we left . Much better at the Breakfast Joynt . Fast service and great food . My tummy is happy
The food was terrible . Lobster was made out of rubber and that ' s was the first time I didn ' t finish my filet mignon , because it was unchewable .
Dirty and overpriced . Came here expecting good food for a good price based on reviews and info but was fairly disappointed . Only plus is their service was okay . Would not come back .
Nasty . Gross . The griddle must not have been clean because my eggs , hash browns and bacon all tasted like old grease .
Worst experience ever ! Do not order a tuna sandwich . If you do the staff will be vocal in shaming you of your food choice .
The spicy chicken is great but the bowls are 95 % rice and 5 % meat which is not good ! ! I thought this place might be better ! Disappointed
Hate this location personally . We only drop by here for a quick coffee but the drive thru and inside always has a massive lineup and the staff are retarded . Better to find another Tims .
Horrible service and overpriced . Waited forever for our food and they always forget orders when they are busy . Food tastes decent but not amazing .
Ghetto . Inside of the place is ramshackle offices with a garage . Lot is tiny . Car selection minimal . Never going back . How has this place been here so long ? !
Terrible Customer Service Lawnmower Dept I will never go back Service in the past ok Today not the case
Nasty food ! Way over priced for the quality . The best tasting thing there was the soda .
Not worth the high cost . Go across the street for a bit better grub if you want to spend the money .
I like this place but they closed without notice today . I brought bunch of friends . . .
Terrible . Just terrible . No flavor . The only thing good was deep fried dough balls in sugar . The snow shrimp was good . Overall if I could give it 0 stars I would . Barf .
They never have any taro balls . Please change your name and stop giving false hope to your customers .
When I got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese , banana peppers and pepperoni . Next time I ' ll pay the extra fee for more toppings , if I ever from here again .
Food was terrible for the price . $ 16 for a burger and the patty tasted frozen , the bun is harder than a rock . Overall for the price the food is terrible
Definitely not . Unskilled , unprofessional , not craftsman like skills , did not tidy up . Ripped us off - took our money and then filed bankruptcy . Check out public records . Shabby .
The staff was super nice and delivery was quick . However for three large pizzas it was over $ 72 . The pizzas were plain with no flavor . Looked beautiful but zero spice
Meh - not impressed . The guy was super distracted , they didn ' t seat me by my friend even though we were the only 2 in there and the gel manicure didn ' t last .
This place was alright . The price and the portion doesn ' t match . It ' s nothing different compared to a hole in the wall Chinese spot . I ' d rather have gone somewhere else .
This place continues to go downhill . Service is slow and food is below average . It used to be much better . What happened ?
Funny my burger didn ' t look like the add pics it was bright red inside . Scary for a hamburger . Will not be going back , and the line to order is slower than Disneyland .
I was really looking forward to going here , what a let down . Nothing special about the food here . The burger I would rate average at best and cold fries . Nothing special about this burger .
Food was disappointing . Waited for a long time while they said the wait was 10 minutes . The falafel itself was alright but cold . Wouldn ' t recommend it .
Horrible service , what a bunch of con artist . I highly recommend staying away from this shop at all cost ! If not expect to be ripped off .
Gave free home consultation , but never received a quote . All I heard was I ' ll have it tomorrow . . . guess tomorrow never comes . . . even three months later
a cockroach was climbing on the desk . only one waitress . worst service ever . dishes took one hour to serve
The pizza is good , a little limited in variety , but that is the traditional thing , I guess . Does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out .
I will never go back to this pei Wei again . Every time I go I ' m disappointed my noodles are sticky and soggy etc
Stopped by Monday for our first trip here . At least 50 people waiting outside . We won ' t be back .
Street taco meat was over cooked and the black beans were completely under cooked . Server spilled our host ' s dish . Probably not going to come back here again .
Below average food over priced would not recommend many other choice on the strip I had the filet and prime rib . . was excited with the menu
Poor service . Terrible food . Soggy and undercooked , no understanding of the problem . Took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza . Had our money refunded the food was so terrible .
This place sucks . The employees are stupid and mostly always mess up your order even when youre the only costumer there . If I could I would give it zero stars .
They changed the name to Get air and won ' t accept already purchased groupons for Rockin Jump ? ! ! ! Horrible way to treat customers !
Had scheduled a service for Monday between 4 and 6 . He never showed up , never called or texted , just left us waiting .
Worst buffet i ever had . All food are cold and look not fresh at all . Taste bad as they only focus to serve tourists from china .
The atmosphere and management made me want to chug a gallon a bleach and hang myself . The manager looked like a child molester .
Been here a few times previously . As the other reviews mentioned , the pho sucked ( thick flat rice noodles , crappy broth , etc ) . No love for Xe Lua unfortunately .
Prices aren ' t bad , but if a waitress rounds down my change when bringing it back , it ' s your last opportunity at my business .
The service is terrible . Servers are rude . The food is over priced . The ambience is terrible . Food is okay . There are better Ethiopian cuisines in town . Would not go back here again .
Food is consistently good here . Portions are adequate , but the service can be slow . The space is tight , and parking can be an issue in lawrenceville .
$ 14 for a draft beer ? Only reason I stopped was because we had walked all day . I know the strip can be pricey but come on ! !
I went there for a nice style with layers . The stylist chopped it up like crazy . All I can do is where a hat until it grows out .
There steak fajitas was horrible , beer and beverage size not worth what they charge you real disappointed with them
Food was absolutely horrible - the worst meal of any kind my husband and I have ever eaten . A frozen dinner is better .
HORRIBLE WAIT TIMES . 3rd visit and each time the wait has been 1 hour + ! Very inconsiderate ! Last time was a 2 . 5 hour wait .
The bagels I bought on a Monday morning at 6 : 30 were so hard I thought I would break my teeth on them . Maybe I ' ll stop another time to try again one day .
Very slow more conversations amongst them selves than with customers . This location use to be very people friendly , that was another time .
I always had good memories from this store . I bought many hats , boots and coats . Just now I was there , the owner , she was not treating me well . Never will go again .
Wheat bread is stale , very dry and no flavor , very disappointing to get home and my sandwich was not what it should have been
absolutely horrible . am I allowed to give this - 15 stars ? terrible service , terrible food , terrible wait time . all in all a terrible place . don ' t go here !
Size is shrinking after their 2nd store opening while prices remain the same . Service still inconsistent from rude to here you go . I will need to find myself a new noodle house in RH .
boo . messed up my order and had over - the - counter - static .
This is the worst company ever ! ! ! Both times they have been to my house they have done more damage than repairs . NEVER use this company . Very unprofessional and inexperienced service men .
Usually I have no problems at this location but a sassy little Hispanic young lady with too much makeup on had nothing but attitude .
The food is good the waitress was from Mexico and she makes you feel right at home even though it ' s a Japanese restaurant she is great my wife and I both think she was a great hostess
Sad , uneventful food . Went for lunchtime on a Saturday and it was incredibly dead . Only plus is that my son and I didn ' t get food poisoning .
Bad service and overpriced mediocre food . Save your time and money and go to Jacob ' s or Barberian ' s instead
You ' ve got to be kidding me ; $ 10 for 6 pieces of mediocre sushi ? ! ? ! Highway robbery . . .
I have no idea how this place could get over 2 stars . The atmosphere is okay , our waiter very attentive but the food , gag .
The linguine di mare I ordered for takeout was missing it ' s lobster
4 : 20pm just walked in and then turned around and left ! First time I ' ve ever seen a Paradise Bakery that dirty !
Chicken is good ! the salsas and their refríed beans are very watering as , their horchata has 0 sugar 0 flavor taste more like Ice melted their food quality has been decreased bad !
Brand new McDonalds but is super slow ! Waited over 30 mins for our food - slow service ! ! ! Get it together people 30 mins was way to long .
I should have listened to Mike M . - This practice has deceitful billing practices and ate up $ 2 , 000 or more on a teeth cleaning also .
Walked in at 2 : 15pm and left at 2 : 30pm with no service . Only two other tables and they already had their food . Store needs new management and wait team ! !
Had the carne asada nachos 4 dollars more for carne and it had very little of it . Not recommended to pay 18 . 95 for it . Good server though .
I travel for a living I eat out a hundred times a year . Sunday evening full restaurant full bar no bartender servers getting their own drinks can ' t get service you fail .
Bad service , steak not cooked to order and Caesar salad was not good either . Only thing was lobster was decent . Couldn ' t even get a refill on water ! Won ' t go back !
Only two words " Don ' t Go " . Unless you like food poisoning ! And I ate Cooked food ! ! 2 days in the hospital - - save yourself the money !
Bland food , zero seasoning . . . Wait staff average to poor , won ' t be going back in a hurry , plus side nice location and generally nice restaurant .
Chicken and shrimp over cooked no Popeyes sweet tea or jambalaya . Not a great Popeyes restaurant .
Why doesn ' t anyone answer the phone at this location ? ? I ' m trying to make an appointment for a passport .
This company has not paid me my final payroll , as of now its two months . This is not the way a company should treat people , it ' s not nice or right !
Not much ambiance . . . Limited to no seating , pastries ? ? ? Different business in rear , not available to patrons .
Worst gluten free food ever ! All the baked goods are greasy , gritty & flavorless . Just gross & way over priced !
Ok service The crab bites were way over cooked Prime rib burger dry with no flavor
The place needs more staff . Employees are always in a short supply . I was looking for several things and they had most of them .
2 lackluster visits , and I ' m okay with skipping it . It ' s very pricey for what is provided The menu looks and sounds great , but the application falls short .
Worst KFC I ' ve ever been in . Restrooms are horribly maintained . Always out of things .
The name of this place should be changed to Gross & slow , I meant to write avoid this place YUCK ! ! ! They just do not know how to cook anything .
Huge hype , disappointing results . Perhaps they were too distracted serving Martha Stewart that night .
Management sucks ! Manager placed me on hold for over 15 minutes . Never ever going here and I will never recommend it . 2 thumbs DOWN !
The employees here suck ! So hard . Screw this place . Your food is decent but the losers serving it suck ! Bye
Probably one of the worst Starbucks I ' ve been to . Out of breakfast items and slowest staff ever .
The salmon was burnt and the manager was rude . My family will never go back . There are too many good restaurants around this area .
Don ' t come here for a drug test unless you like waiting for an hour when you probably already have to pee . Front desk staff were uneasant as well .
Very slow service with limited customers . Waited over 10 minutes for someone to come to the table . Food was ok
Yuck ! Had dinner with a group of four on Saturday . None of us would eat here again . Any other restaurant in the casino would have been better .
Cheese was not melted , taco shell tough and chewy . Very little meat in taco , which did not taste good to me . I was very disappointed
Over - priced , tiny portions of ice cream that tasted " meh " . Disappointing considering other options nearby . Sorry but , I won ' t be back . . .
Pizza is average - they use the " sweet " sauce which I do not care for . Pomo is better . Service was very slow and not very nice .
People are VERY rude . ClassLESS place . nobody cares about everyone ! dont go here ! ! worst hookah bar ever !
Delivery took over an hour , the food was cold and low quality . Fried rice tasted like cardboard . Very disappointed
Chaos on earth , no enough cashiers , too expensive stuff , slow service . God bless Amazon
This used to be one of my favorite steakhouses . It has been slipping for years now . No more Hank ' s for me
Walk in & walked right back out ! Not the cleanest ' Donut Parlor made me not enough want ' Donuts anymore that day .
I ordered a beef dish and it tasted like a lamb . I didn ' t like the food . Service is good .
Worst half - assed imitation of a poorly run buffalo wild wings I ' ve ever seen . Terrible service and idiot hostess made sure no return trips will ever happen . Pathetic .
Meh . In a pinch it ' s fine , but there are way better burrito places within walking distance . Very heavy on the rice . Pretty bland .
We made a reservation because of the ratings . We looked over your menu . Looked very appetising but got to entrées and all said Prices varies . Why ? Not a good look . . .
Update the tIme . I went at 8 : 40pm Monday night and they were closed already . Not 9pm .
Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life .
Had two orders of half chicken , the bones around both were black and really unappetizing . Wont be ordering here again . Customer service was good its just the product that is really bad ! ! !
$ 10 voucher for $ 5 is not honored . cashier said i have to spend $ 20 . this is misleading advertising from yelp .
WORST customer service I have ever experienced . From the sales staff to the service staff . . . they are all slimy guys trying to rip you off ! Horrible service ! ! !
Over priced , coffee is not as good as dunkin donuts . E ven mcdonald ' s , coffee is good
If you pay 9 dollars for a meal you should get a burger that doesnt look like someone played hacky sac with it
One of the worst pizza I had . They did not even bother to make the pizza correct for me . Overpriced . I would prefer blaze Anyday .
I went to this nail spa twice . It looks so nice on the inside BUT on both occasions my nails looked awful . So I give it a big MISS from now on .
Wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought . . . WTH sbarro ? Now mediocre isn ' t even bad enough u have to go sub par with it . . . Smh
This place is very loud and the staff are not friendly . The food is ok and the drinks are pretty plain .
Was just in this restaurant and my credit card was declined . They really need to use chip cards . I just used at two other establishments in Kent . Get a clue . Very unhappy
ehhh , this place is overpriced for what you get . Poke eats has better bowls ! i wanted to explore different poke bowls , but wouldn ' t go back to this place .
ahaha hahaha ahhahahah ahahaha . . . . . uhhh . . . . no . No . simply . . . yeah . no .
It ' s seriously just a grass field . Surrounded by homeless people . Not a fan at all . Plus in the summer there is zero shade anywhere . Not on the field or parking .
Greeted with a damp musky smell of freshly mopped up vomit . After drinking half of a Manhattan I discovered that there were two dead flys at the bottom . Classy .
Disappointing experience . Messed up our order twice and took 45 minutes to get our food .
It was similar to any chain restaurant in the states . People were nice , atmosphere was mall - esq , food was OK .
The service was soooo slow and we were one of 6 tables ! The food was cold and lacked any flavor ! One star is being generous !
It ' s a decent buffet for a low price . The food is the same everyday . It never changes and it ' s usually cold by the time you start eating .
Wife and I both got sick over their pizza . It didn ' t taste right . I did like the peppers they use . But that ' s the only nice thing I have to say .
The long haired dude that served me looked and acted like he wanted to chop me into little pieces with a machete , so I just left . Thanks for nothing : )
So far not impressed . Here for a bachelorette party and we have been here for 45 minutes and no food yet . Asking for drinks . Short staffed . Not impressed
2 night stay . Elevator door got jammed . Ancient toilet clogged TWICE ! Ice available on 1st floor only . Aside from proximity to subway stop , there ' s nothing good about this hotel .
Breakfast was mediocre at best . Bland . Not cozy . We live close and never go here so it ' s just not our fav breakfast place . Service was ok .
got a chicken shawarma sandwich taste was pretty good stomach issues 2 hrs later though
Not a fan . This chain feels like the " Subway " of burrito chains . Very bland and generic compared to Chipotole or some of the other chains . Needs improvement .
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER HAD ! ! We had 2 separate waiters and they both sucked ! Attitudes were terrible . They took forever with our orders . Ugh . Very dissatisfied with this location !
Ordered for the first time . Won ' t do that again . It didn ' t taste fresh . It was hard . Had burnt pieces on it . Really disappointing . . .
I ' ve been there several times . I ' ve experienced the following at each visit : 1 . Stale baked goods , 2 . Expensive , mediocre coffee 3 . Indifferent service , approaching surly .
Why is this theater so filthy ? Dirty ! Trash and popcorn all over the floor ! CLEAN THIS PLACE !
Picked up a dim sum takeout order no utensils no napkins . Rating very low . Food just ok .
For nostalgic purposes only . The ice cream and sundaes are weak and it is looking so grungy and run down these days . Get your sweets fix elsewhere .
We went there at 5 : 00 pm on a Sunday and they were closed . God knows why . . . .
Used to be pretty good food , but service has always been an issue . . . my last visit here was not good . Food quality is sub par .
Just wanted to say I had a bad experience at this establishment food didn ' t taste of that great save your money go somewhere else
Place was ok for pho fried rice very plain and over filled with onions and vegetable over all won ' t go again
Looking forward to the food .
Got a living Social Deal and showed up , but it it CLOSED . Thanks to the owners not paying rent . The landlord put a sign on the door . Needless to say not impressed .
Kristina did message me and apologize and stated that she was not the manager on duty that night and will look into the issue more .
Horrible . My gel nails could have been done by my kid nephew ! NEVER going here again ! !
Everything is twice as much expensive as harkins and twice as small . Harkins all the way and amc just stay away .
Poor customer service and rude staff is what you will experience here . Think twice and don ' t go here .
with that pricw . the foos is horrible . i ordered a sushi platter . and the taste is soso , the eel sushi is highly fishy
They rushed taking my acrylic set off which hurt . My gel manicure on my natural nails is peeling just a couple of days later , that was over priced at $ 40 to begin with
Attitude sucks Food don ' t matter Restaurant hours says closes at 9 . 30 And 8 . 30 they were closed once
Opulent by all means ! Don ' t seat at the bar . Rude bartender ! Seriously , I feel that people that work in bars and restaurants in Vegas , hate their job or tourists .
Le seul point positif est que ce bistro est accessible sans sortir dehors . Sinon la bouffe est très très moyenne . Je ne crois pas y retourner à moins d ' une méga tempête de neige .
Looks like they shut this place down - as I correctly predicted in me review in 2012 . Well deserved . C ' est la vie
they need to get a health inspector in here asap wish i could leave 0 stars . . . eat with caution .
Service was poor , food wasn ' t great . I would much rather go to Texas roadhouse for nearly that same price . Won ' t be going back .
Happy with the logo . Did not get everything promised in the premium package ( what a joke ) Feeling ripped off
Ordered a Hawaiian pizza , got half Hawaiian , Half Cheese , and half burnt . They vaguely describe that their " sandwiches " are Calzones . They ' re kind of good .
Nothing special at this place . The food is just Ok , and its not middle eastern food , its some indian mixed place .
Where is the good old Cantina 1511 ? ! Bad location ! Slow service , bad ambience . . Few years ago it was my favorite Mexican restaurant , not anymore !
Do NOT do business here ! The agents can swindle their vendors and the broker could care less about returning your calls .
Their rolls are good . Chicken meh . . so so . The mash potatoes are horrible . Its like they threw the box itself that the potatoes come in .
Expensive and not very tasty . The chips and salsa are horrible . We will never return . . . Ever ! With Lindo Michoacan is down the street why did we ever stop here ? ? ?
One word for you . . . not good ! Actually that ' s two words . The place is a smoke fest , old and tired ! No valet service and our bathroom was disgusting . Cheers !
Please do not trust this women she scammed my organization out of 500 . 00 . She also lied and said she paid it back .
We got our money back and left . They microwave their food to order !
This has to be the worst Starbucks on the planet . Terrible service , never get an order right , horrible attitudes , and on and on . Pitiful .
they make really , really strong drinks . other than that , its elimidate with no way out .
Sad for the first time we went tonight after dinner at 8 : 47pm and they were closed employees inside but door locked . Hours say close at 10 pm Disappointed
The beers are good and there ' s a big choice , but the server is one of the most rude I ' ve ever seen . I won ' t come back .
Horrible acustics , so loud inside . You can hear everyones conversations . Good coffee though .
Theresa was in direct violation of the ADA act . Some people need to read up on it before discriminating against veterans with service dogs
This is the wrong address ! ! The correct address is 777 Alpha Drive Highland Heights Ohio .
I ' ve been in line for 40 minutes . Only 3 cars ahead of me in my lane and 3 in the other drive thru lane . Unacceptable
Stopped with my daughter for the first time in over a year . I will not return . There were no correct orders coming out . The food was tasteless and no one had a clue .
This bar use to be hopping when it first opened but now its nothing special looks sort of run down and its never full
Had a very poor waiter named Paul b . Won ' t coming back ! ! ! The manager Susan didn ' t seem very responsive to customers needs .
We will see about the food . . . Did call ahead seating and are told we still have to wait with every one . . Fail . New steak place next door will hopefully respect their customers .
It is my opinion that this location serves iced coffee in place of cold brew . The flavor , mouth feel , and acidic feeling in my gut are indicators for me .
I had Barrio food truck at a graduation party on Saturday and I got food poisoning . At least 40 others did as well .
Lack of hygiene ! If you care about your health , stay away from this place . I can ' t comment on the food since I asked for a refund and walked out after what I saw .
Biggest Waste of money . EVER ! Signed up my whole family . Paid a fortune . No results .
The customer service rep I spoke to was very rude and very disinterested in helping me . I will not use this service again .
Really poor service - always understaffed . I even called customer service to request someone help out and it took 20 minutes for someone to show up . So disappointing ! I usually have better luck in Waxhaw .
Was just here at 11am and it wasn ' t open ! Waited till 11 : 10am and left ! Open on time when advertised !
Nasty and awful . The whole family had the chicken kebab , with was very hard coded with lemon , way to much . The tomato was under cooked . Even the rice was coded with lemon .
Drive thru is terrible . Took 15 minutes from the time I placed order to get the food . Unbelievable and unacceptable . No more ! !
The service was very slow and the waiters not really friendly . However the food was good but over priced comparing to what you can have in other restaurant around .
Bland and overpriced . Not sure why the ratings for this place is high , food was terrible .
Never again . Most of the food was horrible . Salty salmon , Sandy clams , horrible crab legs . .
The worst customer service I have ever seen . The clerks had the attention span of a five year old . The call taker was rude and unprofessional . I don ' t recommend this place to anyone .
Not very good and definitely doesn ' t taste like authentic Mexican food . I ' m a Cali native and this doesn ' t even come close to comparing .
GONE ! This place is CLOSED ! I think the Owners retired ! I ate here one time right before they closed ! The food was so poor I did not want to write a review !
Oh come on . Jason ' s deli . Are you kidding me . Terrible place . I ' m always amazed at how popular this place gets . I guess advertising works .
The management philosophy and the staff at LA Fitness is pathetic . Cannot believe this company is still in business .
The new management is awful . The turn around time is brutal and the customer service is even worse . I would not recommend .
Horrible service ! At a dance comp and have limited time to get food back to the girls . Only one person working .
Well the waitress was really nice and was working hard . But she had to do the place on her own . Food came out cold . : (
Horrible experience . The worst moo Shu pork . Never again and will tell people to never go there . Awful service
I never understand why this place is always hot . Turn on the air condition in Terminal C
Horrible , terrible service . I would never go back . There is no parking space , valet is 18 dollars .
Your rate will go up a few time a year . Staff not the nicest and will argue with you about using trash bin .
Worst pharmacy service in the entire state of Arizona , the store and staff absolutely wonderful and pleasant . The pharmacy staff is rude and completely unprofessional .
This place is straight Bull . First messing up my account and not even giving a refund for their mistakes . Worst customer services in any gym I ' ve been too .
The food is alright , not that great . Chicken briyani is very dry . Just went there once .
Poor service , with worse food . The only draw is obvious from the name of the restaurant . But that is why we have the internet .
Much better buffets in this town so look around before him choose this one it ' s very average food
I ' ve never waited so long for so little food . Mediocre , incredibly overpriced food at that .
Many , many open tables and yet a 45 minute wait ? How can you not handle volume at your location in the center of town ? Understaffed ?
The food is great . The manager is awful . Worst experience because of him . Wouldn ' t go back to this location .
This place was actually disgusting on every life level . If I was starving and the only thing to eat was a rally ' s burger I ' d probably die .
I understand that places need time to clean up but locking doors over 20 minutes early for carry out basically loses business forever .
Don ' t do it ! You ' ll regret it ! ! Paid $ 200 for high lights and walked out with fried hair ! !
Worst Starbucks in Las Vegas . Only go here if you have 45 min to kill in a drive thru
The food was okay until I found a hair in one of the dishes . The way they handled it was disappointing as well . I definitely would not return .
Within an hour of being home after eating there , the three of us had food poisoning and got SO sick ! Never eat there ! Horrible !
The cookies were hard and came out while we still had our food . Refills took forever and just really didn ' t care for the wait staff .
" Quick Lube " isn ' t so quick ! ! ! Have been waiting over an hour and can still see my car sitting first in line . . . Take your business else where ! ! !
horrible food . tacky , dirty atmosphere . honestly i ' ll never go back , the food quality is incredibly subpar .
Waited 20 minutes for a burger . . . on a Tuesday at 3pm . . . no one in line . Enough said .
Set me out Brunt food left real bad taste in my mouth . i would think they would take some pride in their cooking !
This place was much better when Tony was in charge ! Not sure what happened , but now it ' s run by a bunch of inexperienced kids .
The spaghetti i ordered was just like a kid meal , even though as afternoon tea meal cheaper than regular order , still not acceptaible .
We ordered food and it never came . Service was rude and security was rude . Place was poorly lit . Other patrons were also stuck waiting for their food . Don ' t ever come here .
TRASH . Its like a gross ass food truck inside a convince store . I highly do not recommend this place . Just turned my stomach thinking about the food poisoning this hole in a hole caused me
Pros - reasonable prices , prompt delivery , friendly service . Cons - bland , greasy , sugary .
Horrible customer service experience ; couldn ' t even get past the receptionist . Refused verified insurance coverage , inaccurate cash pricing , poor attitude . Overall an underwhelming and less than positive experience .
I have to be fair and say that the operations manager contacted me . We are working on a resolution . This counts for something . Will update upon resolution . . .
This hotel doesnt provide tooth brush and paste . What a suprise ! The lady at the front desk was rolling her eyes all the time when we checked in .
Menu is a scam . Mediocre taste . Next time I ' d visit Ramen Bar right across the street .
Standing at counter for 10 minutes while 2 associates carried on a conversation and 1 associate walked passed me and did not offer assistance . Very poor customer service tonight . Language not appropriate either .
Worst service . Had to ask for a server after 20 minutes of people walking by . They ran out of cholula , asked why we needed napkins and waters . Wouldn ' t recommend to anyone .
The only plus to this place was that the bartenders are on their game , otherwise leave it for the Jersey Shore wannabes and slooters that get turned on by extra extra medium Tap Out t - shirts .
Just don ' t see how they ' ll survive . . . many better burgers and fries in the neighborhood and very expensive in addition to uncomfortable seating and blazing lighting . . . . aaaarrrrrgghh
One star enough just for the logo , otherwise the burgers aren ' t worth to spend your money on it . I ' m angry cuz It cost more and taste like Macdonalds
Boring uninspiring lunch menu . Many better more exciting places to goin Vegas . Take a miss on Mesa .
Who knows . . . called and said were open , but arrived and said didn ' t open till after 5 PM .
THIS IS THE WORST NAIL PLACE EVER . . . . save your money . They have no clue what they are doing . It was the worst 2 hours of my life ! ! ! ! !
Maybe . Don ' t go off lunch hours because you ' re gonna get old food . Maybe it would be better during peak times .
Not helpful when it comes to Memberships and problems with add - on services . Dont hang out at Gates to help customers with problems
Poor communication of events that will affect restaurant traffic , terribly limited parking .
Tourist trap . Like a bad cafeteria on top of Mt . Washington .
Was here for my sons birthday . Came with a party ordered apps , drinks , and meals . . . they don ' t even cover a birthday dessert . . . pretty disappointing . . .
I did not think the food or service was good at all . I left half my lunch on the plate .
They would not repair my iPod classic , even though I already have the replacement battery and tools . So basically useless .
Very pricey and the items aren ' t that good . Their customer service is ok but needs improvement as well as their snacks quality .
Margaritas are ok . Stay away from the food . It was pretty gross . Too bad , we were excited to give it a try .
Service has been steadily declining since it first opened . The menu changes have gone from great to bad to good as well . Definitely hope Deagans can return to be a premiere lakewood spot .
Do not go here . Horrible customer service . Owner is never around . They will not take responsibilty if they shrink your shirt . Look somewhere else .
Nasty . Disgusting . Too much alcohol . Gross . Yuck . Go . Somewhere . Else . RUN !
This place had high hopes . The meat in my sandwhich Tasted and smelled bad . My family and I all got sick after eating here .
A large pizza with Sausage ( more like pepperoni ) , mushroom and green peppers for 30 $ ? ? ? ? Are you kidding me ?
The worst Dr . Ever Mr . J Phillips . Always cancels never has an appointment time open .
My mom didn ' t like creap . the sandwitch so so . and definatey noodles just gross , what the dessert was ok . Clens Brule . I had a stoke . .
Staff was rude . Course was goofy . Conditions were terrible .
Extremely rude management . I ' ve never dealt with any establishment so poorly ran . I highly recommend avoiding this place and choosing another restaurant within the area .
Online it says open 24hrs and so does the lit sign on the front window , but we show up at 11pm and its locked up and lights are off . . .
Went in a few weeks ago . Long wait , cold food , waste of 60 $ . The only good was the margarita
Nasty ! I was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews . Just went to NYC in Oct so wanted to compare . Sorry not NY style pizza .
Not open during business hours with a " we ' re sorry " note taped to the door . I went out of my way to get here .
A Gr 12 Grad with a CBE school . $ 92 a ticket , food was not even palatable . Absolutely disgusting .
This place sucks . Delivers wrong food and specially non veg to a vegetarian and then ask me to go figure it out myself Never ordering again
Says closed at 2 : 00pm and no sign was outside saying closed until I literally walked up to the door and then closed magically . You crackers are a * *
Drinks white mocha every day , only this location makes its deferent . Today same thing , but also they messed up with my kids ice tea . Today was my last time I been in this store
Not even a 1 - inside cashier pleasant but drive thru baristas very rude . So however was working 8 / 13 / 16 at 11 : 50am , put a smiley face on and be happy .
Tried it for the first time and left unimpressed . The food was under seasoned , and over priced .
Food is to spicy for me . Plus I hate that I have to go in the store to pay for my food if I forgot cash .
The most underwelming Adonis . Short hours , small selection , limited sales . Some staff are nice , some staff are hostile .
NO FREAKIN COFFEE ! Hotel is dirty , service sucks , no bar , did I mention no coffee ? Wouldn ' t recommend this hotel to the drunk driver who killed my parents . 0 / 5
Came here today the female clerk is very rude and somewhat discriminatory . This store is very divey and hidden shame she has such a bad disposition no wonder it ' s never any customers .
literally spent 20 minutes in the drive thru . . . there were only 3 cars in front of me and I only ever saw one bag of food go . . . the others were drinks so annoying
Went for lunch right after they opened . Cold food , had to ask for utensils . I hope it ' s better other times off day . Not impressed .
Had clam chowder . Complained about lack of clams . Waiter told me is canned . I was astounded . $ 6 . 49 for a bowl of canned soup . Ridiculous . NEVER again .
Food was average at best . Friendly bar staff . But not worth the cost .
Waited a long time for my food only to have it come out with the avocados still having part of the exterior peel and interior nut attached . Yum . . . .
Not very impressed at lunch today . Who dresses a salad with sugar water ?
Not open till 11 . Drive from the other side of town to get some salsa at 10pm and they were closed . Waste of time .
Beef was overcooked and dry . Chicken was basically the same , virtually no flavor . Waited almost 45 minutes for overcooked meat . Disappointed .
Horrible service ! Won ' t come here again . Food was ok nothing special .
Not worth it . The $ 17 lobster roll is soo small and does not have lot of flavor . Don ' t waste your money on this .
I ordered the Chicken BLT via Postmates . It was so over cooked , it was hard ! Ok fact , it was more charred than my charred broccoli ! Horrible quality !
Highly overrated . The food was awful . Service mediocre . Hair in the food on top of it . So disappointing .
Awkward place no music , just really quiet , and empty . I give 2 stars because the lady was really nice and other wise would of gave it no stars
Meat and two place . Pretty decent food . Great service . Divey .
We stayed here when we got married . First of all we walked in and neither of us were not impressed . The casino was so not pretty .
I like the store but when it comes to the actual pharmacists they don ' t even deserve 1 star . They are racist and have poor people skills . Will definitely not be going back .
Slow slow slow . . . The line is literally from the counter to the door to the building here in Vegas . 1 person working the desk . All the other companies around the desk are empty .
They can ' t even answer their phones . Save your time and go to Santan Ford a few miles down the road .
Used this company for years when I got on Medicare they turned against me there a Medicare provider but do not like to do business with Medicare patients
Horrible service ! Ugly decor ! Horrible processed food not sure why anyone would give it a good rating .
Stopped in for a trim . No wait which was great , but my bangs are far from straight and entirely too short . I figured any place could handle a bang trim . Lesson learned .
Shitty food shitty services , why would everyone want to go back here and eat ? Huh ? Cuz they put a lot of msg in the food and make it tasty ?
Service was ok . Got charged extra for beer cheese that came with Pretzel bites and charged for a video game that we didnt play .
Probably one of the worst casinos I have been to . When the dealer says " this is just like yesterday , everyone was losing " you know to never come back .
The drive thru was so slow we had to abort our afternoon iced coffee run . Based on other reviews of this location , it seems to be a common theme , slow service .
Meh . Pretty forgettable subs . Jimmy John ' s and Milio ' s are better options for delivery .
Home of the broken ice machine and the 45 minute wait for 2 sandwiches ! The management of this establishment is a MESS ! Avoid this at all costs !
So gross the guacamole was grey . The ingredients are not fresh nor are they flavorful . Do yourself a favor and skip this place .
Sbarro is mediocre at best on any given occasion however it turns out its especially bad at airport locations .
Waited over 30 minutes to be seated . Ordered steaks . Not very good . Tough and chewy . Salad and bread were the best part of the meal . Will not be back .
they forgot a sandwich and also made another incorrectly . how do you forget Sausage on a sausage egg and cheese ? I would never recommend anyone go here
Terrible I would say about half of all the games were broken . The place has totally gone down hill .
Just got home and my fries aren ' t filled like they usually are
Dated room smelled like smoke . AC didn ' t work . Sink was rusted out . Stains on shower curtain . Avoid at all costs until they update .
I called to make an appointment . I was told they could get me right in for a pedicure . When I arrived , five minutes later . There were five people sitting there waiting .
food = good service = nonexistent literally did not see our waitress still trying to flag someone down so we can pay and leave haha
Corned beef croissant was ok . I had to ask for my donut three times then the guy questioned that I had already paid for my donut . Donut was stale . Only good thing was the coffee .
Worst place to eat . Staff is extremely rude . I don ' t know what the owner is doing with this place . They should shut down and teach their staff some manners first .
Customer service needs improvement . Lots of seating inside . You can get refills on your tea and iced coffee while you are there .
Nothing spectacular . Just convenient depending on location . Not enough of salmon on the Supernova sandwich for its over priced . Very stingy . Employees were very rude overall .
Horrible service do not go here complete waste of time I will tell everyone I know not to do business with these people
I ordered a slice of chocolate cake and got something more like a chocolate mousse no cake involved pS I don ' t like chocolate mousse !
On my last 2 visits for dimsum the food has been a bit disappointing , especially the siu mai ( pork dumpling ) . Service was not great either .
Just like everything else , prices go up , quality goes down . This place is definately not the Matta ' s I grew up with .
Drove by two weeks ago and the store was empty and the sign gone . Was very sad I believe most scrapbook stores are gone now .
DO NOT order from here . The food is absolutely disgusting , the place is unsanitary , and the staff is over - the - top rude . Avoid at all cost .
DO NOT EAT HERE ! Overpriced food that tastes horrible and a staff with a bad attitude . There are plenty of other great buffets on the strip ! Do yourself a favor avoid this place .
Bouncers power trip Rude Wouldn ' t let you go up the stairs to grab your friends ( maybe 5 steps )
Came in last night and was seated with no drink menu ( thought it was a wine bar ? ) then given waters and ignored for 15 minutes . Got up and left . Thanks a ton
I checked this place out today . Got one of their mini meals with Dhaal . Gosh - the dhaal was super salty . A definite " avoid at all cost " place for me !
I ' m a cattle rancher from Nebraska , and these folks do NOT know steak ! Overpriced for small servings of beef that is definitely not grading Prime !
Pathetic food and too small servings . Everything we ordered is tasteless and under cooked .
I have been twice and was not impressed with the food , but its 24 hours so its a plys when you want some random food .
Great Location but slow service . I am waiting just ice coffee 15 minutes . Now , not much customers are here .
I should not even give them one star they are FUCKING horrible . Customer service is horrible ! ! ! Needs new staff and manager . Never again ! Don ' t waste your time or money here !
Meh ! Nothing special not sure what the fuss is all about . Didn ' t really do anything for me . Won ' t come back .
Terrible , flavorless hamburgers on stale buns with mediocre fries . Save your money . Salads are premade & refrigerated .
This is price to value type of thing - it cost a lot but in return you receive salty food , ok service , and underwhelming deserts . Overpriced coffee shop . Oyster selection was good though .
Fast no wait seating on a Saturday night . . . but be prepared to pay for substandard food !
Never . Over priced salt lick with an autistic staff .
Well I see that they have tried better to keep this place clean they can use improvements none the less . And I find it stupid that they removed the blinds from the south side of the building .
Would have been good , but something seemed to be missing . . . . . . . . . . . . flavor ! Service was quick and the staff was friendly
The pot melt was horrible , service was horrible , and the venue was very dingy . One of the worst iHops I ' ve been to .
So NOT rokkin ' : Space did not ROK my senses . People definitely did not ROK my lust meter . Drinks did not ROK my liver . Price ROKKED , free .
Got sick from the food . Not flavorful at all , definitely won ' t be coming back . Just my experience when I went . . . . wish it could have been different .
The wait is ridiculous even for being busy . There was an hour before our pizza even went into oven . No pizza is really that worth it . I ' ve had better .
Not good , I got take out from eat24 , super disappointed . I got the panag curry , it was bland and salty
The dessert was wonderful - some rhubarb thing with ice - cream . The food : - |
If you like food that ' s been dropped on the floor and serve to you anyways then this is the place to go otherwise the food is really good .
Worst bank & worst customer service including their corporate ! Hope they go bankrupt . I ' m glad to have canceled everything with them !
After finding the place walking around the building looking for the door , the food was not good at all & over priced . Would not go back
Crappy coffee with crappy attitudes from staff to match . . . don ' t waste your time or money here .
You can ' t place a phone order after 5 pm . You have to go there and sit forever waiting on your order . I ' ve decided to just go to B & M ' s .
I had an appointment with Larry last week never showed never called to cancel . I sat waiting for hours . I email and called the next day with no response .
I have been coming here for years the food is good but the service sucks today was my last time if I wanted to be treated like shit I would stay home
The ambience is really nice , but service is awful , and food is mediocre . I don ' t recommend it .
Out of all iced teas but didn ' t tell me that when I paid for it and they could do a refund .
Walked out , very unpleasant staff , refused to apply offer from the my piece mobile application
Not accepting new patients . Why is it so hard to find mental health providers in Las Vegas ?
Why is it that you have a coupon for a $ 5 oil and filter change upon check in on Yelp but won ' t honor that price ?
Well excuse me but waiter told us rare was not a problem ! Also if you used Fresh meat instead of frozen it would help cooking !
Dont get the beef hotdog . It is expensive and small . Taste like all beef hotdog from Costco .
The pharmacist at this Walgreen ' s location is a HUGE jerk . Not helpful at all . Won ' t be visiting here again ! ! !
Waited 10 min just to get 2 fraps ! ! There was No one other than me in the drive thru ( 5min just to take my card and 5 extra for try the drinks ) . Ridiculous !
Instead of writing a review , I ' m going to post a video of me wringing out a measurable amount of oil from a donut from TBC .
Terrible . I want my $ 5 back . Super dry cake and thick frosting that was practically all cream cheese . Ate two bites and threw it out . Extremely disappointing .
I ' ve been here many times and don ' t know why I have reviewed this place yet . It ' s a cool dive bar if you don ' t mind the nonexistent / terrible service .
Its Indian - American fusion restaurant . . . . Naans are good , chettinad chicken is just ok . . Dessert and appetizers are over prized . . . .
When it works it ' s fine . Ive had outages each day since last Friday . Everytime I call to report them it ' s always an " area outage " . Everyday ? Really ?
This place has been shut down by the city . Now they won ' t return my my calls regarding the money I ' ve paid fit my November wedding .
Business line it ' s always slow they are short on staff I runa business and I need to go fast to do the deposit and always it ' s like 30 min in line
The reception is very rude and unfriendly ! They are careless about patient ! When I called them to talk with my family Doctor , they hanged up my phone when I was still talking on the phone !
no very impressed . Bar tenders were beyond rude , and inisting you tip , hounding you to tip . Really not cool .
The material was not fresh . The pork in the congee tasted weird , the shrimp dumpling is cold and the soup dumpling is not fully cooked !
The service was okay , only one person serving and bartending . The pub food was not good and the food was served luke warm , The interior needs a complete overhaul . Menus were paper and filthy .
Absolutely a terrible experience - they definitely do care this evening cannot get served . No bread service , wrong starter brought out .
Read so many good reviews I went in with high expectations . Alas , service was very slow , and the food was really nothing spectacular , Not in a hurry to return .
Worst place for food ! I love Taco Bell never had a bad experience anywhere else but this place just sucks !
Worst service possible . I ' d write more here , but all the other 1 star reviews say it all . These people have 1 job and they are blowing it .
First and last time I ' ll be ordering at this location . Rude employees . Hoping the food would make up for the terrible customer service but they messed up my order too .
this place sucks . . . . food is horrible .
CLOSED ! ! ! ! ! ! Invalid number ! No longer open ! Website still up with no contact info . Google map links you to a strip mall and an Indian grocery . BS
I literally waited 20 minuets for sake and spice chicken . They said pull up to wait no one was behind me . Once I had a bite my chicken patty was cold . Smh
The company was good many years ago . They have terrible support now and their systems have not kept up with the times . Avoid .
Slow . Slow . Slow . Slow . 3 people working and not a large crowd but they allowed customers to taste almost every flavor which slowed down the process to a snails crawl !
Absolutely horrible service . Waited at the airport for nearly 50 minutes for a shuttle to arrive .
Food was marginal at best , service was awful . Was expecting a decent meal , and got Airport - quality Chinese food .
I ordered buffalo but they delivered BBQ , called they blamed customer . Wings not too big , mediocre at best , drenched in sauce , never will call again .
Fancy Buca di Beppo
Cancelled my reservation I made a week in advance with a few hours notice . Not even an apology when I got phone call .
Order came cold and incorrect . Ordered off Grubhub . No fault with Grubhub . Won ' t order pizza from this restaurant again .
I ' m not a fan of a company that leaves the flowers at a neighbors house and leaves a sign on the door to go 5 doors down . We never got the flowers . . . .
The food here is the worst Mexican food I ever had . The staff here was friendly but had to ask other waiters to get refills because our waiter was no where in site .
Whack tacos . You live in Arizona , go get some real tacos . WATCHOUT for cars when leaving the drive through
Food is good but portions size is vwry small i asked for salad and kabobs but the salad was a mini quater plate for 13 its really a small portion but yes the kabobs were fresh
Their are two older women that work the deli at times they always seem to be having a bad day
If you are in a hurry , do not come here ! ! Worst customer service , no one is ever behind the counter ! And the sandwiches taste like crap . DONT COME HERE
Went last night for my dad ' s birthday . Our experience there was fine , but now my brother and I have food poisoning , likely from the Southbridge sandwich .
Got food poisoning for a second time . I know it ' s cheap , but does it worth it ? Please avoid shrimps rolls .
We ordered two Chai lattes $ 8 . 00 . . . one was lukewarm at best and the other was cold . We will never go back ! !
Don ' t take this shuttle bus ! ! ! ! ! The worst ever . It totally ruined my mood in my first day of las Vegas . Wait till die .
The worst service steer clear ! They steal money from you , over charge without permission and even have it in writing ! Avoid this company at all costs ! !
Same management and workers from old Native . Still horrible service and food . Except now they can also ruin breakfast food .
These people are awful . They treated me badly when my mother died . I would never use them again . Mccandless Floral are amazing . Beautiful flowers .
Food and atmosphere were good but terrible service . Definitely not what you ' d expect at this kind of establishment , and quite disappointing .
Horrible food for the price . Screwed up my take out order . Served me raw meat . See picture . I hate Outback , and I only went because I was give gift cards .
Make sure you know how much your bill will be , otherwise they will rip you off . . . . The owners are not honest .
Not to our liking . It took 20 minutes for them to make a Boba smoothie and it wasn ' t really good . Had a funny taste to it .
Possibly the worst Starbucks i have ever been too . . Manager speaks over costumer and has about zero knowledge of customer service . . .
Walked in @ 6 : 20 and was told they were closed . Says they are open until 7 on the door . Probably won ' t be back due to inaccurate hours posted .
Smells bad . Insanely expensive . Crap service . Gave them 3 chances and NEVER again . Recommend avoiding .
The cream brûlée French toast tasted like just toast , it was a waste of time and money Don ' t recommend it
Not too impressed . Unless you ' re a tourist . . . it ' s not really worth the time and money .
Beware , beware , beware , At & T sales staff are dishonest , there promotions they offer are switch and bait . stay with Verizon if your smart .
Awful ! Everything is loaded with cheese and grease . Wish I read the reviews . Even lettuce on the Caesars salad with light dressing was soft & soggy . Go elsewhere ! ! !
Horrible service ! ! ! Understaffed and water taste like crap , would not come back . Would never recommend this place . . .
really bad service . The lady at the info desk was sooo rude ! And she didn ' t help at all . Always go to brimley & sheppard branch . More experienced staff there
Worst experience ever . Don ' t waste your money . Food is not worth a dime and yet they charge $ 50 per person on an average for a funnel cake
Yaki Tacos were yucky ! Skimpy on the teryaki and dry . The fries were hard and cold . Place is going down hill fast . I wont eat here again ! WOOF ! !
I just moved here from Chicago . Lord help me . Friendly but slow , inaccurate service and lukewarm , inauthentic " Mexican " cuisine . First and last time .
this guys are Mexican and they want to make a Japanese meal like really stay on them tacos bro shiit ! ! !
Nice bartender , good wine , mediocre food . I got what was supposed to be their signature pasta , and the meat was really poor quality ( lots of gristle ) .
Cupcakes have been in the display for who knows how long , taste that way . Waste of money , Sprinkles cupcakes amazing compared to these .
Poor service , poor attitude , out of products , and they took forever to get us our food . Worst dunkin donuts I have ever been to .
Horrible , waited over an hour in the lobby . They need to learn how to staff appointments properly .
They suck big time ! ! ! - don ' t give ur biz to this store - they r rude , they put u on hold for hours - lmao
Management is really bad . Waste of time and money . They tell each customer the food is coming when it ' s not .
Disgusting Chinese food . After the dirty diner let out that they had several major violations I knew I would never be back . . .
Was much better as last place . food is not so good here and the service matched hope they improve thou soon
Ordered on Uber eats . . . . Way over priced considering the portion size . Paid 73 bucks for enough food for maybe 1 hungry person . Cornbread wasn ' t good . Tasted prepackaged and microwaved
I finally went upstairs to the " museum , " and they have great selfie lighting , but not a whole ton else .
First time here and I wasnt impressed at all ! I should have gone to the dairy queen : - (
So so . Not the same eds . Need Improvement . Service great . Atmosphere good . Food lacking .
Horrible service . . . face to face as well as drive - thru window . Shady . . . shady . . . shady business goes on behind the building between employees and guests .
Pretty run of the mill bad pizza . Tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made . But the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok .
Services , food , and servers are WORSTEST ever I have seen . DO NOT COME HERE . Food is also wrong according to my order .
Yes , prices are TOO high for poor food quality . . . this is a slot joint with cheap high priced food .
Employees friendly , but do a terrible job cleaning . I rather deal with the long waiting at Fabulous Freddy across the street .
Nothing is communicated across departments and this place does not care about patients .
Terrible delivery order . Fried mushrooms were cold and soggy . Forgot the blue cheese for wings . Awful
The food here is flavorless I been here 4 times order different plate on every visit and everything is tasteless even the hamburgers this is my last visit thanks Applebee ' s
Food is awful here ! ! ! My bartender was nice but it sounds like other people have issues . Go to Yuengling instead ! !
Overprice ! ! ! ! ! ! Sooooo few taro balls . How come a few taro balls plus some ice costs almost $ 10 . ? ? ? ?
sooooo slooooow . . . 25 Minutes in the drive through - Hire MORE or BETTER employees OR O wait - I can eat elsewhere
Normally good food but just paid $ 7 for a ceased salad to go , tiny , maybe 4 bites - not fair
8 . 50 for small take out box of plain rice with some sauce and 5 small pieces of chicken . NOPE Overall tasted OK but not worth it .
terrible food , it was semi tipid . warmed up in a microwave . Fu was not great . The owner , lady nasty attitude
I ' ve had better . . . Portions kinda small . Not the best food and the people all seemed kinda stuck up in there .
The level of professionalism in this office is a joke . I ' ve been here 3 times and each time I ' ve waited over 2 hours after my appointment time to be called back .
Place is not longer open anymore . They donate museum to Las Vegas National Museum of History .
No water or towels to wash the windshield and some of the pump buttons broken causing me to swipe card 4 times . I won ' t be back and recommend you avoid .
It ' s like Denny ' s but worse , it ' s convenient cause it ' s in the hotel / casino but definitely profit over putting out a good product
Older airport , lots of construction . TSA pre check line was as long or longer than regular lines in most airports . This breeds rudeness among both passengers and TSA staff . Not a good experience .
Great service ! Saw a bug ( the indestructible r - type ) in my shower . Otherwise clean
Went to this place on Friday and ordered a dinner salad , pasta with marina and meatballs , and in the middle of the night I woke up with food poisoning .
Disappointed . Overly priced and boring except for bread and Alfredo sauce . Pasta was overcoked and eggplant tough . Wasn ' t a good value .
It ' s pretty good . . . Except , there are always fish eggs wrapped up in even the vegetarian ones . Not a nice surprise .
They overcharged us by $ 3 on a salad then when confronted charged us automatic gratuity . First time there , never again !
This place is Closed as of November 28 or something . Upsetting BC of the drive to get down here and paid for parking .
This location skimps on the cheese of the Extra Most Bestest . Especially when compared to the Cheyenne and MLK location . Go there instead .
Rude as hell . The woman misquoted me , then tried to overcharge me and said " $ 7 dollars more because you owe me tip . " Go somewhere else .
First experience with this restaurant . I ordered the chicken quesadilla fajita style . I literally had to pick off maybe half of an onion chopped into tiny pieces . I love onions , but in moderation .
The worst Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at yet . The food taste was very disappointing , bland and cold . I would never recommend it to anyone .
Pretty aloof pharmacy staff . They give conflicting information and seem fairly clueless .
Got my food and saw a live sewer roach moving around on my sushi plate . I GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE IN A BIG HURRY ! ! ! ! ! !
Horrible - they use chicken that ' s been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food . : (
Every time I come here it ' s a different price and they have a different excuse . The cleaning is about average . Convenient location but you should really avoid this place .
I would recommend Yellowtai instead . Same chef , much better food and environment . Slightly higher prices , but still worth it .
A Mexican restaurant with no chips and salsa unless you are willing to pay an extra 4 . 95 . Talk about milking you for every penny they can . Very dissapointed .
Holy Salt . Had the fajitas and they were beyond salty . Also ordered a shrimp cocktail and the salt was unbearable . Staff is gross as well and owner was drunk at bar .
Bunch of useless workers socializing in the store but not helping customers . Don ' t go there .
Why do you allow people to bring their dogs into the store ? It ' s VERY unsanitary . . . I literally watched this dogs hair shed in the produce . . . gross .
Tiny portions , tastes horrible , and I was sick afterwards . Skip this place and go directly to Pamier Kabob a little south .
Experience eith manager very unprofessional . Order had four mistakes plus shortages when arriving home . Brice , the manager did nothing to correct this situation . Will not return to this location .
So bad I don ' t even know where to start . Read all the other reviews and you ' ll get the idea .
I got the brisket sandwich and there was about 3oz . Of meat . Texture tough and chewy would not recommend .
Lots of potential . . . Horrible product . Only thing good here is the house chips . My wife and I tried to the first time today and won ' t be going back
Bud light . No locals allowed . Well maybe the VIP . This is not who we want in Phoenix . This is not what we ' ve been fighting for .
Food sucked . No alcohol in the pitcher of margarita ! ! ! Great place for people watching .
Small arcade , lacks selection and many of games that my kids were interested in were more expensive in long run va the pay per time concept . Won ' t go back .
Bad , bad service or actually none . Was ignored totally when tried to go in for lunch .
We just ordered to go lunch and ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad and there in literally 11 tiny pieces of chicken on the salad . We wont order to go from here again .
I think that Subway is awful and this place is worse . They have bland sandwiches and then for some reason they squish them . I guess that is their thing , but it ' s not good .
I was told someone would outreach to me regarding the pricing I was given and I still have not been contacted .
Don ' t bother if just driving through Vegas . NO parking available in parking structure . Obviously just for local business people .
I just can ' t handle the poor , huffy service anymore . The food is good - but there is better to be had and with a smile .
Terrible food and service . The best dish was the rice .
Server with buzz haircut as rude . Place was dirty . Not the nostalgic fun place they pretend to be .
Our waiter forgot our order of nachos until we reminded him . Wife ' s fries were burnt , my " seasoned " fries had exactly two pieces of visible seasoning and otherwise were normal regular fries .
Very dirty and fries were cold and don ' t get me started on the bathrooms . I would drive a little further to a different location .
Prices were a bit extreme for how little we got . Chicken was weird and not at all we would would have minimally hoped for . Only positive was the hot salsa was perfect amount of hot .
The sandwich was good but not for $ 12 . Good Dutch crunch bread it was fresh and the sauce is good but not worth a return at that price .
Overpriced , gross food that tastes like it came out of a toilet . Blech !
How does this place still exist ? Greeted by muscular woman - disgusting chicken wings - horrible microwaved clam chowder and $ 8 pint of beer . My night only got better when I got out of there .
Is this Chinese food or really the lowest grade products around . The food was horrible . With every bite you could taste the poor quality . Never again .
Don ' t trust that they will actually have cars when they show several options available online . You ' ll show up to rent a car and be completely let down .
Great beer and Mac - n - cheese but extremely rude staff . . . beer and Mac aren ' t that good and I ' ll take my business elsewhere next time !
Overpriced greasy food . . dark ambiance . . Not vibing with it or the overpriced meals . . Better out there
Garbage and the guy behind the counter wasnt friendly
Rude owners ! Wouldn ' t recommend as they made their paying guest feel uncomfortable and unwelcome !
Very slow and the receptionist was rude ! ! But the people who cook food in the kitchen are nice ! Nothing special at all !
I like Applebee ' s food but the service at this location is really , really bad not once but twice .
The food sucks . They brought us bread that was stone cold . The entrees had too much salt and the service was average at best .
Good location , nice menu , Bad management ! Stuffed French toast not even toasted on the inside - cold . Manager must be 18 and has no training in customer service
Was known as Amelio ' s . Business has closed his door for a few time and reopened
This place is crap . Made an appointment , drove 2 , 5 hours . Then when we arrive they say they can ' t help us because they are booked .
Good crowd but way too loud . If they had real dancing the loud music would be fine but it ' s more of a bar so being able to talk would be nice .
Quality wasn ' t there , felt like I got ripped off ! Had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans really had no flavor . Would never go back first and last .
Just got some food from this restaurant and you can tell that they do not have the same cook because the food was not that good at all it uses to be very good but not anymore .
My husband got food poisoning after eating here on Tuesday evening . Never going back .
Something has changed and the Red Lobster flavor is just not there any more . I was a regular .
Maybe it was once a charming diner . . . so disappointed ! Everything tasted pre - frozen . Servers seemed very tired .
This facility needs management . They fail to provide service you pay for and have the staff offer excuses that are unreal . The staff is good , management shows a lack of concern and attention to details .
Weak ! Menu sucks like the food but people were nice . Save your date night for elsewhere .
atleast 4 - 5 homeless / transients allowed to sleep inside this McDonald . Good Job Managements ! ! ! !
Disgusting fish and chips special at lunch last Friday . What was I thinking . . . when I could have walked to Penrose in ten minutes .
This guy has an attitude and will ruin your deal if your a realtor and kill your buzz if your a buyer . Our agency will never use Eagle Home Inspections again .
Terrible food I ' ve ever had . Such a shame because it ' s a great place to hang out . Maybe some day they ' ll get a new chef .
Good food . Overpriced . Overrated . Snobbish service . Typical Fox concepts . Elitist / Hipster employees . Unimpressed .
When you walk in it smells like fabuloso and sewer . The foods is only good if you need a good cleanse .
Terrible food . I had the rib eye . I would have done better at McDonalds . Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else . Anywhere but here .
Take out for a burger takes over an hour , be prepared for your stomach to eat itself as the clock ticks down for the longest take out in human history .
They put the stupid self - service kiosks in this store . Incredibly inconvenient for the customer . I will not return to this McDonalds .
The service was slow , plates were dirty and our water came to the table only after we asked for it three times . The spicy Asian boneless wings had a funny taste to them .
Overpriced . Tortillas taste raw . Barely a step up from taco bell . Taco shells could be from taco bell . Not impressed at all .
Ok if you ' re in a pinch . Otherwise subpar work . I ' ve been there multiple times . Good polish selection and front desk is the most positive point of this place .
Disappointed with the experience had here . Iced almond milk latte tasted off and baristas seemed disinterested in customers .
Ordered a antipasto chopped salad . . What I received was a box of old lettuce and absolutely no meat or veggies . . Really ? ? ?
Stopped while traveling in the interstate . Heap , quick and hot . Gave the extra star because there was outside seating .
The food was good , ehich is why I come here . However , their customer service is terrible .
The portions alone are worth 2 stars , the front end service was fine , the food tastes like frozen leftovers , skip or use the 20 % off coupon n shock yourself .
It took forever and they gave me moldy chicken . See pictures . Not eating there again . VERY DISAPPOINTED .
Great new building , same sh * t service and food . Go there for drinks but not if you ' re hungry . ' Nough said .
The Workway in Scottsdale is no better . Very unprofessional and not organized at all . Terrible listening skills and rude .
No wine selection , no rum selection , hostess with a snotty attitude . Spent about 10 min here before heading to a Kettle Black for a real bar selection .
Don ' t bother . There are too many other plumbers out there who will appreciate your business and not give you the runaround .
Just a rip off of the scores that used to be in its place . Same exact décor besides the new Dallas BBQ sign and the menu is a scores menu to the tee
They claim the " meat " is cut off and reheated . . . . it ' s not . Staff is really nice - food is really bad .
Slowest place ever . We ordered 3 smoothies and it took 20 minutes to get them . Young staff doesn ' t care and has poor customer service .
Ordered delivery . It was late . The guy got lost and seemed high . I asked for soy paper and they gave me seaweed . Gross . Never again .
Worst $ 7 . 01 I have spent on a cappuccino that tasted like a regular Tim Hortons coffee that was very bitter .
Horrible waiting staff / customer service , mediocre food . My rating is based on the food . The have a fantastic hot salsa .
Used to be a Subway with a great staff . Just changed to an independent sub shop . Just like Subway without the logos . Really bad . Hopefully they get better .
Everything about the place was mediocre . It was empty on a Saturday night . The quality of the food was very mediocre . It tasted like prepackaged sushi .
I eat breakfast alot around Waxhaw and every time I come to this Burger King the drive through gives me horrible service . The price is different every other morning and I always get the same thing .
Slowest McDonald ' s ever . No matter the time . No matter the day . They do not utilize their over flow waiting area and keep you waiting forever .
Location that ' s it . . . . . high priced drinks , mediocre service , bad food . . . . this place was a lot better 1 year ago . Find an alternative
Walked in and received a horrible look from the bar tender as she was on her phone . Sat down and waited 15 minutes with no service . Decided to leave and no one cared less .
It was alright . Don ' t see what the fuss is all about . Kind of heavy pizza . Tried it but going back to my east of Chicago !
Real pushy . Explaib on a need to know only . Page by page before you know it . . . Youre had . Walk away from this " Deal ! "
convenient to my office for a quick snack pick up but Extremely overpriced . the same bag of chips is exactly twice the price from what i can get from Sobey ' s . ridic
This place sort of reminds me of the browns , they never have their act together . Some Sunday ' s or days they simply won ' t open . Other days they only take cash . . .
Pretty bad customer service . Got the vehicle just fine and it worked well . Guy behind the counter were talking bad about a customer in front of me and didnt seem to care to help her .
Long line . Manager on duty turned down additional help on the phone . Not sure why . Waiting . . .
Good prices on food and drink , but not great food . Had fish & chips and perogies , all terribly overcooked . Friendly service , but unsteady . . . probably could use more staff .
Meh , it was ok but a bit expensive for a diner . The wait staff was a bit aloof .
Don ' t bother trying to call this " 24 / 7 " service doesn ' t return calls . Tried twice at 8pm and 9pm and no bother to call back . Waste of time .
Ru San ' s just stole an hour of my life . Only go if you don ' t mind leaving hungry and exasperated .
Broken machines , super shady and a complete waste of time . Don ' t go here
Bad service and never enough cheese pizza , this place used to be good but it ' s gone downhill .
I ' ve ordered late night delivery for pizza , pasta ans wings as an experiment . Everything sucked . I will never order from them again .
My friend tried so hard to work with this guy . He is a spoiled brat . I will NEVER be shopping there .
Pho was mediocre at best , overpriced , and a small serving . I am not a crazy eater , but I was hungry at the end of my meal , which should never happen with pho .
Took an hour to get my food ! Ingredients missing from rice dish , food came out cold and undercooked . Would not come back .
How is it that this McDonald ' s only takes cash after 10pm at night . I have been here more times then I can count , and they won ' t take debit cards , only cash .
Drive thru for a chicken share box and been told I need to park and wait for 10 mins lol . And I ' m end up only waited for 14 mins . Not bad .
Unbelievable ! ! ! ! Returned after a terrible visit ! ! ! To be treated worse ! ! ! GREAT SAUCE ! ! ! ! NEVER AGAIN FOR ME ! ! ! ! !
Horrible service ! They refused to cash my payroll check ( drawn from their bank ) unless I had an account with them . I WOULD NEVER BANK WITH THIS TYPE OF BANK !
Horrible . A " quick " bite has taken a total of 1 . 5 hours and the food was horrible . There is zero direction in this place .
Place looks nice and the man who I think is the owner is friendly
I guess this is an OK stop if you know what you are going for . But we have experienced only slow service , and mediocre food
Didn ' t live up to the hype . Slow service . Long wait . Nothing we got tasted great . Bathrooms were disgusting . Host was also a waiter so that really slowed things down
The prices went up after new ownership and the quality stayed the same . Also , less daily specials and less items on the menu . Two stars for convenience , otherwise one star .
Food was ok . Not worth the cost . Service was satisfactory . Did not leave with a desire to return . Live music was great !
That ' s the nastiest crap ever . I wanted a taco salad . I don ' t know what I got but it sure wasn ' t a salad .
Would have liked to use them , but they apparently are too busy to answer the phone . Too bad . Will need to find another non - dealership Toyota service ship .
Bring back the prairie grain salad ! ! !
inedible ! their spaghetti and meatballs look and taste like dog food , although i wouldn ' t feed it to my dogs . their spaghetti used to be so good .
This is the worst Tim hortons in the area . The drive through takes for ever and they constantly get the order wrong .
Sushi here is average , no better than what you can get from the cooler at harris teeter . Overpriced drinks are even more over priced and service is sub par
Very disappointed in quality , # 43 taste like blended milk chocolate . Will not be come back to this place . I think they might be under new ownership .
Technically zero stars . Literally the most repulsive sandwich I ' ve ever eaten . Do not spend your money here .
Please someone tell me why they put ice in their juice ? ? ? ? It could have gotten 5 stars if they didn ' t use ice . Ice in juice , like who does that ?
Been going here since 2011 food quality went downhill , tuna texture rubbery , not fresh . Not going back .
如果做创新餐厅要丢掉传统菜的口味和优点，那还是不要创新了。天妇罗互相之间粘在一起，鳗鱼卷两个两个粘着而且米饭是松松的。不想说了。扫兴
Very high prices , $ 25 . 00 for a t shirt alot of things they sold are over priced and there cashiers are not that friendly
I hate them . They don ' t know how to turn off a maintenance light on a car newer then 1995 . They told me I needed synthetic oil , I don ' t . Very unprofessional .
Ordered chilli cheese fries . Terrible ! ! ! Way to much chilli , cheese no melted . A big soggy mess YUK ! ! !
Go to another one . Car side sucks . Girl was awful . Wrong order came out then we sat for 45 min and then she forgot . It was shameful go to macaroni grill .
The Food we ordered was very uncooked and was near edible . Chicken in my burrito was pink ! ! The fries in my Carne asada fries were soggy and the meat was horrible ! Unsatisfying Experience
Doughy pizza with a bad sauce . Plus I ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them , charged me for them , and refused a refund . Do not support this business .
Great beer , marginal food . Fish and chips were really greasy and other items were not great . Loved the beer choices .
Completely unprofessional , the photos were terrible , and the whole team of photographers were very crabby and rude . Do not hire , EVER !
The pizza is ok nothing to brag about and the service sucks had to go to the counter to get my drinks refilled and they looked at me like I had three heads .
My friend got drugged here on her bachelorette party and ended up in the hospital after only consuming one drink . Sketchy . No thanks .
Nothing is authentic here , too much cheese , beans and not much flavor . The chicken looks it has freezer burns , no flavor because they boil it before putting if on the grill
Carne Asada quesadilla came drenched in grease . Completely unnecessary - no respect for consumer health - literally bathed in grease and dripping from the inside out . Cmon man !
If you want super slow service , Luke warm food , forgetful waitress , bugs in your water . . . . you ' ve found your restaurant !
The food and customer service is severely lacking . Our server did not want to be at there and it showed ! With so many other great restaurants on Stephen Avenue , I will pass !
Food was mediocre and expensive . Our waiter acted like he couldn ' t be bothered by us even though we spent a lot of money . This was our most disapointing outing in our Vegas trip .
If you love yourself , don ' t do it . If you don ' t love yourself than you better hope your insurance covers for major major diarrhea after eating here .
Tried to set up an appointment for oil change but after 30 mins on hold decided to try another place
Poor service and waited far too long for our food . When it finally came it was lacking flavour !
Worst Deli ever ! ! ! ! ! I can ' t believe it took 45min to get my sandwich deli meat . The slowest workers in my lifetime , very polite but kept socializing with each other .
Hair chopped on one side ; not cut on the other . Won ' t go back .
The cauliflower sliders were mehh . Not worth 10 dollars . They were not crispy either . Quite disappointing .
Never know what the food tastes like , waited for over 45 mins , with 9 open , dirty tables . In the time we waited , the couple ahead of us sat , ordered , and ate .
Yelp didn ' t give it a good rating but was willing to give it a try . The lobster sandwich was overpriced for the small size and the sandwich was bland and tasteless . Very disappointing
Bartender Very Slow , shoving his face with liquorish . Took 35 min to get an over priced Ruben .
got fish & chips . very generic diner . credit card not accepted .
Cupcakes taste like straight up sugary store bought cupcakes . Customer service was awful . This place is definitely strictly for pretty pictures only .
ordered half a pound of chicken tenders for 6 . 00 and got 4 tenders . ridiculous . they were cold .
Before I could even book an appointment the receptionist ( and she claimed owner ) was blatantly disrespectful toward me .
Worst experience ever although our waiter was awesome the food was ok , the ambiance was a little tense i find . Definitely not coming back
The Service he is bad the lady behind the counter is rude an slow an lazy omg it took her for ever to put stuff out an take a order don ' t come
I will never go back . . . . . . . Waited 45 minutes for our food and when we got it it was cold . . . . . . .
Came to eat and the food was horrible the fish was over cooked and the fries was over cooked and asked for nachos no chicken and it was filled with old tasting chicken .
The worst hotel ever I stayed 2 nights there and I brought bed bugs with me to my home
It was fine . The food was OK but I ' ve certainly had better and fresher Thai food elsewhere . I would not go back .
It ' s was a bit pricey for the quality of food . Huge portions but I would never be able to finish . Don ' t think I ' ll be returning .
I brought my boys here and the guys seem to pass all new clients to the new barber . Unfortunately he isn ' t very good and I was disappointed with my two boys ' haircuts .
Terrible parking lot with bums everywhere . Good thing the curly fries were hot . What a neighborhood bars on all the windows .
Not the best service in my opinion . You get charged if you don ' t finish the all you can eat ( that you pay for ) also . I will never come here again !
Should have looked at the ratings first . . . made a hasty choice - salty , greasy . . . your on your own . . . good luck !
While not the worst food I ' ve ever had it was close . Bland , over spiced and over cooked .
A bunch of idiots working here choose any other place ! Worst service ever ! And bugs in the restroom . STAY AWAY More like half a star at its best
Waited half an hour for a few burgers . Severely understaffed , huge line , terrible experience . Never again .
This place is a joke ! ! They give you a hard time when wanting to cancel your membership and act like car salesmen . Can ' t wait for Planet Fitness to open in Surprise !
Disappointing . Breakfast panini had no flavor and salt really didn ' t help . Can ' t recommend
UPDATE YOUR FREAKING HOURS ! I ' ve been to your place twice when you were closed when yelp said you were supposed to be open .
When you answer your phone you should probably answer hello " great wall cuisine " and you probably shouldn ' t advertise that you offer delivery when you don ' t .
The last five times I been there they don ' t have the key ingredients for the wraps . Staff not friendly
This needs to treat all customers fairly and not just a few and never prejudge anyone based on skin color that is all
Wasted free nights on this dump . Living out of hotels 10 months a year , I would know . Old hotel and breakfast was as bad as hotel maintance . . . Neighborhood is really suspect .
Ok burrito but rude staff . . I don ' t need to go back ! There are may places in the city that make you feel wanted .
Overpriced and slightly biased . Didn ' t allow certain people to go in because of their no jeans dress code , yet allowed others . Makes no sense to me .
Will not come back , Miso soup is terribly salty , the rok and roll sushi roll is a joke , only 4 prizes to a roll
Dump . Tacky décor . Shitty beer selection . Not worth the effort of finding . Go to Velveteen instead .
There ' s an old man with a ponytail that ' s works here always so rude either drive through or in store ! He shouldn ' t be working with that nasty personality and bad customer service !
Avoid if you can , doctor says one thing and does another . Long story but I don ' t not recommend going here .
Ordered a beef shawarma platter for take out . Spent $ 19 on some dry beef , dry rice and very few veggies ( exactly 4 pickled beets ) . Very disappointed for the price I paid .
Overpriced and kind of strange environment , I like more traditional mexican food .
They are NO longer open . I loved this its sad to see they closed down . There food was good and not badly priced .
The bar was half - empty at Friday night , but we waited one and half hour for our food . Doesn ' t worth it . Not going there again .
Seriously don ' t advertise u open Saturday then put sign on door closed . This coupled with the rude people who work here equals not around in five years .
Took my two little dogs in for a wash . Unfortunately , there was no hot water . The dogs were shivering the entire wash . Very sad . : (
Not very good . Pancakes were under cooked and it took forever to get our food .
Poor atmosphere , poor service . Careful with your receipt these guys overcharge the credit card .
Bought a drink didn ' t taste good asked for another one didn ' t want to exchange it . Not like they didn ' t get my money to begin with . Not good customer service .
Good food , terrible customer service . For me customer service plays a huge role in every dining experience . So the attitude of the employees throws me off .
I would never step a foot in this place , Very experience This is one of the most overpriced grocery stores in charlotte , NC Please be aware / check prices of anything before you buy .
Nothing like getting a old fruit tart on your first visit ! No one enjoys a freezer burn taste . Won ' t be back .
This dynacare only accepts patients who have requisition forms from the Queensway / Hurontario clinic .
This location of Verizon gave me the customer service experience equivalent of a car wreck .
booked an appointment nobody showed up , never answer their phone . Clearly this is just some random woman running a shit show out of her house and not an actual business .
Such tiny , average arrangements for the price . Save yourself and go somewhere else ! !
Received a snarky message from this business after Yelp auto generated a landscaping quote and sent it to them . Way to set up future business prospects .
It ' s gross . Don ' t waste your money please ! Hope this helps you !
The new crew is doing a very bad job ! This was one of my favorite restaurants - and the food is just bad : dry and far too salty ! No place to go anymore . . .
These are not real tacos . They put shredded cheese on my shrimp taco . : ( On a positive note , they have good margaritas .
Nasty , do not eat there Taste of food not good it ' s actually terrible . Do not waste your time and money Go elsewhere
The games are lots of fun , but the food is terrible and service worse . Come for the games go elsewhere for food
Had the panang curry and the " Orange chicken rice " both we ' re bland and the panang has the consistency or water . Won ' t be back .
I got a quote for a location in cleveland , but there weren ' t any cars available ? ! ? ! ? so I wound up taking another more expensive taxi service .
Terrible customer service . Took 10 " minutes to get a beer and then the server never came to order food . This is the last time I come into this place .
Worst service ever I ordered my food at 7 : 40pm didn ' t receive it until 8 : 40pm no exaggeration . This is the slowest Wendy ' s I kno in az
Free tortilla chips and salsa are the best part . The margaritas are about average and the enchilladas are ok . The price is right and the decor is good but I ' ve had better .
Do not book any events here , the management is rude and pushy . If you are a DJ and your taking down your stuff the workers will rush you and give you an attitude .
$ 5 bottle of Bud Light , $ 8 per shot of Liquor . No Thanks
Both times I ' ve gone the coffee was luke - warm . Pastries all seem to be focused on being gluten free , and perhaps not surprisingly , taste like crap .
Way overpriced . You need a magnifying glass to see the portions . Pretentious and tasteless .
If I could give zero stars , I would . Poor customer service ! I will NEVER go there again !
This taco bell was friendly and the food was good but i didnt like the way place looked inside . Could havw been cleaner i guess .
My burrito was cold . My wife ' s chicken was dry , tasted old . Salsa was old , not crisp . Sour cream tasted like it had turned . Even the roach on the floor agreed .
What a " great " first impression when you walk in , wait 20 minutes for customer service , and have to talk to a rather rude customer service representative .
Way too expensive for mediocre pizza and small portioned food . Sorry , but you can spend your money elsewhere .
Poor service and mediocre sushi . . . . . don ' t waste your time or money
GO EARLY ! Traffic backs up on the 143 to University and the parking lot is not fun to negotiate !
Very depressing mood when you walk in . Idk what else to say lol sorry Maybe retrain or new staff * * Atmosphere needs work
Service is terrible . Asked two different servers for water but still had to go to the bar and grab them ourselves . Majority of the time inattentive . But the food is good . . .
Good food . Poor service . Not kid friendly . Not reservation friendly . Three separate instances with poor experience . One big plus is Sunday brunch menu .
Another typical absentee Las Vegas celeb chef restaurant serving average food , just a step above Olive Garden .
Assez cher et bien ordinaire . . . Le sandwich était pas pire , mais la quiche était pleine de pâte et insipide . Je n ' y retournerai probablement pas .
They do not have a airport shuttle . They are disrespectful to guests trying to get to and from the airport . Abbi . Front desk clerk especially .
Not great . Service is sub par . Not very friendly . Food is mid line ok . . . . . Disappointing .
Checked out this place because it was on Bar Rescue . It was dead when we went , but the drinks were ok and the place looked clean . Guess I expected more .
It wasnt a luxury place at all . The music wasloud and took a week in calling to get appnt .
Ever since Vons closed . I ' ve been forced to come to this place . I guess the only good thing here is they have a 24 hour pharmacy other than that I would skip this place .
I felt as if the employee was doing me a favor . Wasn ' t impressed by demeanor . I won ' t go back .
Terrible service . It took us 30mins to get our food while other tables were served . Some people came and finishes their meal and left . Very disappointed . Food was mediocre at best .
Got the order completely wrong . Wrong sandwich and left onions when I explicitly said no unions . Will never go back there again
Venue looked good , wait staff very nice but food was not great .
Stopped by for a takeout noodle dish , rice noodles with shredded duck . Too salty and greasy .
Republic was supposed to do a bulk pick up yesterday in Anthem but missed my block . No one is in their office today to take phone calls .
The decaf coffee here is just terrible - watered down . I don ' t think I ' ll come back again .
Stuffed Jalapenos must ' ve been freezer burned or old . I think I ' ve outgrown Jack in the Box . The milkshake was decent , ( Real Ice Cream )
Keeping it short . This place has gone from AMAZING customer service to an excuse making used car dealership . Will not be back all because of Rick .
Think twice when coming to this place . Staff will clone your credit card and steal your money . This happened to three friends of mine .
muy buena variedad pero el cajero se tardo horas platicando con si amigo teniendo linea , tienen de 4 - 5 empleados y solo un cajero , que para variar se toma su tiempo platicando con amigos .
Confusing parking . Nice theater . Very poor service at concession stand . Spoke with manager . She was short and abrupt . Many choices . This is a poor one .
Bad service . Taking plates with food off of the table while we were still eating . Sticky rice that wasn ' t sticky and chicken fried entirely too long . Terrible experience
Very poor service , very poor cocktails and they don ' t care .
The food was very bland , it took over an hour for them to deliver it and the guy that delivered it was extremely short with me and pushy .
Copied another companies idea to use nitrogen . It happens . Prices are extremely high . Ice cream is ok tasting . The line was over 30min long . I will not go back .
This bar smells horrible ; it ' s like a mix of old cigarettes and gross gym . Looks cool from outside tho . A lotta old people inside . Shrug
1st visit . Just ok food . Atmosphere was nice . Pricy for tex - mex , given the quality of food . Limited selection . Waiter was good .
My guess is that the bar is what keeps the place afloat because the food is terrible .
Went there to watch a sporting event . Service was spotty as they were pretty busy . Apps were good for bar food but nothing to go back for . Wings are huge but overcooked .
Agree , worst McDonalds ever . Not only did they mess up our order , they messed up the order before ours .
Their number # 1 special isn ' t the same as the original in Orange County . It ' s too sweet and maybe they just put in sugar water instead of coconut water like the original place .
My husband n I went d other day it smelled like sewer . D food some was good n d other not that good : )
Not open 24 / 7 ! Drove by at 12 : 57am on a Saturday night and they ' re closed . Not cool . Update your hours
Horrible horrible customer service ! I wouldn ' t recommend this place to my enemy . The best part of it is that it ' s cheap but they have bad customer service .
I was disappointed with Hero Burger . I tried their bleu cheese burger back in April and expected it to be juicy and delicious , but the meat was subpar .
Ordered for carry out and we were overcharged . We were told we needed a coupon . Don ' t trust their invoices . Go elsewhere . The pizza will be better too .
This place is ok . The first time we went it wasn ' t to my liking at all . It ' s overpriced . We ' ve been back since but it still lacks something .
Undercooked . terrible dough . basically no toppings . Wings are inedible . How is this place still in business . . . barf .
Food is bland and greasy . Been to several locations , same issue at all . I will not be returning .
Two stars only because of service was decent . All the food came out of either a can or bag . Highlight was the blood orange margherita . This place solidifies my opinion that food in Scottsdale sucks .
Sitting here right now , still no food . Had bad service when restaurant wasn ' t busy . Staff up for all days , or buisness is going out of buisness ! !
Went for the first time and the sushi was good . . . The only complaint was that the sushi rolls were to thick and hard to enjoy . . . .
Pizza Hut is no longer in business at this location , it has been gone for many years .
Came once did a good job . Made a second appointment . Never responded to my calls or texts to confirm . Fired them ! Not worth the aggravation !
Was at a Christmas party catered by them , service was mediocre as was the food . Would not recommend .
Way too loud ! Sound dampening needed ASAP ! So crowded we couldn ' t get a table for hours , couldn ' t get served , couldn ' t hear to order . Will not go back .
Average bar environment and food . Staff isn ' t overly friendly and always rushed . Just for a quick appetizer or to watch a game it ' s ok . Nothing special .
I spent 145 on one pair of shoes shoes ! ! That last me half a month I don ' t even know what to say it made me mad don ' t go to cowtown
Came here at 4pm on Saturday and they were closed . . . hours are incorrect online and on their front door .
Just don ' t . This was the grossest mexican food I ' ve ever had . My friend actually spit out her food .
Gross ! Gross ! Gross ! I haven ' t eaten Jack in the Box in years and now I remember why . The food is SO greasy and a mess . Nasty .
We came here , food delay for one hours they forgot our order . Overall the place is nice to dinner for the summer , food is ok .
The service here was fine . The food came out faster than I remember in the past . I think Carl ' s Jr food is something you have to acquire a taste for . I never have .
I agree with previous reviews , poor customer service for sure . If your that busy with only early appointments . . . why advertise with Groupon ?
Why does it take 15 minutes to get a drive thru sandwich order ? Jimmy Jons this is not .
The wheels were worn to the bone and the axles in the roller skates are loose . It was very hard to control . I noticed a lot of little kids falling also . Be warned .
Not actually open 24 / 7 . Tried to come here for breakfast . . . Like 8 : 30am . . . . And no service
Food not great . Got a burger , bun was cold and u get very little fries for the price . Not recommended
I ordered chiken kabab but I got something look like lactic and it taste was terrible . I was the worst food that I have ever eaten .
Tasty ingredients , but when i highlight clearly the toppings on a sheet of paper and you mess that up , it ' s just bloody frustrating . Especially when i order to go .
This really is the worst smiths ! The customer service manager clearly does not know what customer service is and should be fired !
Former ex bf turned into a oxy and heroin addict because of this dr . Stay away from him .
I didn ' t even eat there because it smelled like shat and it was terrible I walked in and said it smelled like old man diarrhea and turned and left
Went with my mom to Ritter first take cash they do not accept cards , and the food was ok
This is the Dominoes of deep dish . Nothing about my pie was Chicago style . I could rant on with more but if you aren ' t catching on by now . . . .
Average food . Average location . Average drink options . " Regulars " are somewhat obnoxious and the staff seems to focus on them vs . those that are first timers . Original Kenilworth is waaaaaaay better .
Just had dinner here and it probably was one of the most god awful places I ' ve ever eaten at . The service was terrible and prices were outrageous . Will never eat here again
Great if you like waiting for 35 minutes , after calling half hour ago . Annoying as hell .
The drive through chick Carmen is always rude and treats customers like crap . Go somewhere else .
40 minutes in the drive thru and still couldn ' t get the order right . Employees drinking Hennessy bottles from other customers . Just shut it down .
Terrible customer service no one asked do you need help everyone walking around looking lost and stupid . Managers need to get on these Employees . I wish I could give no stars .
The girl at the counter had a difficult time taking our simple order . She also messed it up . Beautiful seating and decor . My beverage was mediocre .
Completely overrated / expect to pay double to triple versus other local florists . High prices must be how they pay for their location and storefront
Amazing Falafels but PRICING needs to improve ! and the service as well ! be careful when driving in this parking lot . accidents happen frequently . Located beside a Starbucks so i can get my morning dose !
Red Lobster is to lobster as Swiss Chalet is to chicken but Swiss Chalet ' s chicken is better .
Went here on a Saturday super busy . Had to wait 40 mins with a reservation . Food was ok . Not worth all the money . Service was terrible . Never will come back .
Food was ok . I didn ' t care about the ambience .
Very few TVs . Really too bad . Plus , lamps at bar obscure TV view ! Slow service for food and drinks . Couple next to me waited 30 min for food . Expensive drinks / short pours
Meh . Prices keep going up . The product is fine . But there are definitely better bakeries .
Food is ok but they keep selling groupons and then have 1000 restrictions so you can never use them . Not very honorable
Very slow with more than 30 min wait time despite my appt . The staff seems inexperienced . Definitely the worst spa I ' ve been to .
Not good , so sloooooowwww , F - all the way around . The place smells like dog pee also . Burnt eggs , and weird tasting hash browns , fat and slow . night is ok
The tables were sticky and the drinks were too sweet . The mango twist straw was not worth it . Would not go back sorry
Food was not great . Chicken kabab was too hard and rubbery . Chicken tikka masala was average . Biryani was decent . Would not recommend .
Do not come here . Dishonest management . Offers the 10 % off yelp deal to get customers in and does not honor it . Just shook his head and said no without any explanation .
Service is definitely slow . 35 minutes in and all we ' ve had are apps . So far the apps are nothing special .
Not awesome , not great either . Found the prices for the brands to be a little out of this world also .
Moved all day , drove all night . Greeted by a rude and aggressive guy at the front desk . No coffee in the lobby after 9am ? Boo .
We ordered from here through skip the dishes . The food came quick but the portions and quality were very disappointing . Not worth ordering from . . would not recommend this restaurant .
This place did not seem clean and smelled like moldy towel . I don ' t think there is much more to say about that
Worst place every . Why bother with appointment if they alway make you wait 2 - 3 hours wait . Finding another Doctor office as I wait to get my labs results .
Service is very fast , hey are very stingy with their food . Good thing I had a gift card because more meat costs extra . .
Stay away . Manager and staff doesn ' t know what the promos are .
Too expensive for the amount of food we got . The food also took an extraordinary amount of time to get there . We waited 30 Min for a bowl of rice with sashimi on top .
Highly unprofessional to take reservations and then make your patrons wait . No apologies or explanations . Epic fail .
The food here is pretty good . I would give it a 4 , but the server gave us attitude for not finishing the rice that came with the salmon rolls . : /
If you make people pay extra for avocado , you should at least put the avocado on the sandwich . Sandwich was delivered , avocado paid for , and no avocado on the sandwich .
The worse Starbucks location ever . Constantly messing up orders and long long long waits . . . . the drive through is horrible and takes 15 mins to get through .
Friendly staff , and very short wait time to be seated and to receive my meal . However , I was stricken with a violent case of food poisoning after dining here . Beware .
Freezer burnt , mediocre at best ice cream . Won ' t be back .
The hostess gave me attitude for checking waiting time . Went back a month later , same service . That makes it or breaks it for me .
Worst place I ' ve ever been in Pittsburgh , lived here all my life terrible staff and lots of bad attitude here don ' t waist your Money or time here ! ! !
Rough crowd . Two people spilled their drink near me . More of a college vibe which is passed my time .
Chicken shit mothafukas cant do anything right , by far the worst place I ' ve been to never again . All of the staff are a bunch of morons that includes the manager ! !
Extremely dirty . Food all over the carpet . Dated . Packed . Broken coffee machine . Not a fun spot .
Service poor . Staff rude . Food cold . Nothing but bad excuses . Really hope they get it fixed .
Too Pricey ! ! I would have given a higher rating if the quality of the food justified the price you pay .
Horrible injera , it was NOT warm or fresh at all . I have been to many Ethiopian restaurants . They explained that I must have gotten injera from places that serve fresh injera out the oven . Wth
I got the Tky Brovo Sdw . They didn ' t have the correct bread so , they placed it on sourdough . A single word . Yuck !
Given they have been sold out to AB , I doubt I ' ll ever return . As a local business they were excellent . I will patronize other Local beers , breweries , and restaurants .
Everytime I come here they mess up my drink . . . The only I like about this location is the baked goods . Never will I return again
This place used to be good , but with lazy wait service and inattentive management things have inevitably declined .
The price has gone up and the food quality and taste has gone down . Big Time ! Truly the worst good experience in a very long time .
cool place with plenty of beer choices . service wasn ' t a highlight . guy with dark curly hair needs to rethink the service industry .
Horrendous service . Waited forever . Please do not take your hungry family here ; they will starve !
Horrible service ordered a rare steak got it well done ordered a Blue Moon got a Bud light
Do a good job but try to up sell me and rip me off every time . And they take freaking forever ! !
There is a minumun order per head rule here which is not listed anywhere in the store . Rip off never come back again .
The place would be pretty good if they were consistent . I picked up takeout tonight . Cold food . No bread . No salad dressing .
I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby . . . and this pizza STILL tasted horrible . Barely average fast food quality and taste . Avoid !
Check in wait is unacceptable . Plan on waiting a couple hours in line . There are numerous hotel staff and still the wait is too long .
AWFUL . Do not go here . Hours are not accurate . Terrible service . I would give zero stars if possible .
Decided after the fact they didn ' t want to deliver . Not happy with their backpedaling excuse once they found out .
This place is shut down ! Phone number doesn ' t work ! ! ! Did they move ? ? ? ?
Terrible espresso martini . . . Fresh espresso ? ? no way it ' s a coffee syrup so tried a margarita instead . . . Worse ! ! Nice waitress though
Very bad sushi , full of rice ! Slow service we used all u can eat menu . I will never go back and will never recomend it to anyone . There r way better options available in montream
Extremely rude . Terrible service . Overcharged drinks . Plenty of better places to go around here . Everyone working acts like they have a stick up their ass .
The food was good , but our server neglected us for the most part and offered us nothing to compensate for my wife ' s food arriving after everyone else was almost finished eating .
Dan is great . Otherwise avoid this place . They overcharge and never file the insurance correctly . Do not go here .
Extremely average food for an above average price . The drinks are not very good . The old old fashioned was watered down and lacked body .
Wintermelon milk tea was made poorly the first time I came here . . . . Super sweet . Service is pretty slow too . Second visit they messed up our order twice . Needs improvement .
Decent food in a cool atmosphere . Service was somewhere between unacceptable and horrible . Expect much better based on the location , place was empty by 10pm on a Sat night .
Terrible service and less than spectacular food / coffee . Chocolate chip cookies are the only thing they have going for them .
Excited to come try this place but no one picked up the phone . We called 3 days in a row .
Awful service . Edgar attempted to repair my phone and damaged it worse . He would not attempt to re - repair my phone or provide a refund . Do not let the cheap price fool you .
Got murder wrongntwice in A row . Manager did nothing other than say sorry . Waste of time and money never will have my business again .
Vodka tonic came to me as a vodka and club soda . Perhaps it gets less sad and pathetic sometime after midnight ( when I left ) . But , it really didn ' t look very promising .
I had a 14 ' pepperoni pizza and The best way I could described what the pizza tasted like was little caesars pizza . Wasn ' t pleasant . . .
This is quite possibly the worst Chinese food I have ever ate . The vegetable taste old . The soup tastes old . Short changed at register . I won ' t be coming back .
All I have to say is no . You should just cook at home because at Toby ' s you will practically serve your self !
Cheese steak missed flavor and was dry . Wings were no good . Prices were ok , service was par .
Poor selection and horrible customer service would not recommend this lousy business .
Sorry Papa . My pizza was kinda bland , nothing really special about it . Instead of the Supreme maybe next time ( if there is one ) I ' ll try one of those specialty pizzas .
during my most recent visit I watched one employee sit in the back and chat for about 10 minutes instead of comimg to the counter to take my order . this place is really hit and miss .
They did a terrible male manicure . Was not happy at all and over priced . Nails were crooked , the shop didn ' t seem clean .
One genius for entire store . Made an appointment and now I ' m waiting while she helps all of the appointments before me . And she is late coming back from lunch . How is this genius ?
Will not be back . Just overpriced and the walls are very thin . The pool , lobby and the restaurant were nice but don ' t think I will be back .
I quit banking with them yrs ago because they charged for every thing even talking to a teller and I had thousands in the bank so a balance didn ' t matter
Was warned that management was poor prior to using this service . My experience was exactly that . Front line staff are excellent .
This yogurt joint isn ' t worth . 55 an ounce when pinkberry / yogurtland is half the price n it taste better . The yogurt is too milky . .
Poor service extremely slow and they will serve others before you I will never come here again . Will definitely keep going to ColdStone .
I usually like Hot Dog on A Stick but in this case I witnessed the cashier count money with her bare hands then touch my food . Are there any food safety standards ?
The pizza was absolutely terrible , the sauce bland , the crust was like thick cardboard and the employees were truly terrible to deal with . Spend your money elsewhere , you ' ll be glad you did .
This place is hard to make appts with and impossible to get simple paperwork from . Poor service . I will be moving all 3 of my kids to a new allergist .
I visited this shop , first i have no good experience , after awhile gave another try and got worst cut , and that would be my last visit here !
Decent burger for the price . However , we waited 25 minutes for a to go order of just 2 regular burgers and fries . I ' ll be avoiding this place until the newness wears off .
Terrible customer service . Absolutely no help with billing questions . Continually spoke over me . You get what you pay for .
no parking , no place to load , and unload your car . small rooms and bathroom . needs major renovation . one good thing location .
They may accept pets but also accept smokers - - the room smelled like a smoldering pile of feces laced vomit . This place is disgusting - - no black light needed to illuminate the extent of filth .
Fun things . Interesting variety and nicely displaced . Good price points but the most unwelcoming staff .
You thought the DMV was bad . . . wait till you experience this Tropical Smoothie Cafe . Epic .
I orden the chilly chicken they put a lot of ginger , I love spacy dragon and Frederick hakka I never change agian
I was told that internet was free at this hotel . When I showed up I found out that there is a $ 13 . 99 per night fee for internet service . Very disappointed .
Got bad measurements here . Make sure to get double checked elsewhere . Not sure if it ' s a lack of training or poor equipment maintenance . But something wasn ' t right .
No sauna , small , very little amenities that other LA Fitnesses offer . Only reason I deal with going here is because it ' s close and my son likes the kids club
Service is really horrible . Takes 45 mins to get anything from servers . There were only 2 - 3 our table and 10 employees . Don ' t go for food or drinks .
Not a welcoming environment . Over priced . Bad service . Save your money and walk a few a block farther to the next bars .
Food is subpar . As is the service . Go farther west .
One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to . Service was non existent , had to order from bartender . Food was not that good for price .
Service was mediocre and food wasn ' t as amazing as fellow yelpers described . The rice ball is way overrated .
No draft beer available , and the kitchen really let the side down . Ordered the Carolina dipper . Came out soggy and not very flavorful .
Love some of the food but I am very disappointed . It took them 30 minutes to cooked my pork chop and it was very dry
New ownership and no more Alex . Service went way down . I ' m not sure about the food . Stay away !
Warm beer cold machines and crappy food . Go to the lodge down way much better option .
Food was terrible my order was way wrong , service was terrible & it took forever to get our food ! Will not go back and do not recommend
the bartenders work hard and are great . . the manager is a retard . i will never go back there ever again . . .
One star for now . Wanted pizza by the slice , as advertised on their website , menu , and neon sign . Don ' t sell it on weekends .
Prices were high and the food is nothing special . We drove a little over an hour to get here and were disappointed . .
Unsanitary . Unprofessional . Cold food . Five piece chicken missing two pieces . Shrimp and fish meal missing the fish and the shrimp was cold . Mash potatoes were cold . Worst Popeyes ever .
Used to like Barro ' s but this location has turned me off . The pizza is just okay , service has been consistently bad , and good luck finding a napkin or condiment .
One of the most careless Starbucks staff over here . They don ' t care for your time . . And they don ' t show any sign of regret for screwing up .
The drinks are very weak and the service was terrible . Our bill was 200 dollars for a MEDIOCRE MEAL . I would never go back there again !
Service is nonexistent . Prices are good for meats , and produce , everything else is super expensive . And this is how they write Happy Birthday on a cake .
Do not buy the Iced Thai Tea Boba . The boba was very stale and hard in the center . I wanted to like you , Bosa Donuts at Riverview !
Can you say SALTY ? ! I thought it was just the salsa that was too salty . But the food was mostly salt . Price is fair .
Whenever we ' re downtown we stop by the Plaza and Pop Up Pizza . The food is okay but it ' s not really impressive . It could definitely be improved .
Tried calling multiple times to get a hold of someone . After every time the phone just kept ringing . I guess nobody cares to pick up the phone here .
Be prepared for a long wait . After 30 mins of waiting they said they forgot my order . Food is good but they need to be better organized .
Worst service , they are liars both the salesmen and finance changed things after the fact , wish I would have never stepped foot in there .
Toronto Island itself I have no complaints with but getting there was a nightmare . The lineup for the ferry was out the gates and I would never go back because of it unfortunately .
This place is so slow ! ! If you plan on eating here you better have time to spare , ugh
Don ' t return the car without full tank or they charge $ 9 . 00 a gallon . What a joke , I ' ll never rent from you again . Your vehicles are junk too . .
Came to try to get my nails cut shorter and the lady said she didn ' t have time . . she wouldn ' t even let me wait till one opened up !
Got food poisoning here . They cook the food for you and the employee cross contaminated the meat . He was constantly handling cooked and then raw meat .
Food is alway good - service seems to always take an hour to get something - go to over easy across the street , they seem to get staffing right .
Bought two $ 16 slushie drinks , no alcohol in them Go to Fat Tuesday ' s instead
I have my 4 year old with me and was told I had to go else were for her to use the restroom . Lost prevention is a joke and so is the staff !
The doughnuts are cake donuts that they add topping to and heat . Way too sweet and a gooey mess . Over $ 4 for just 2 doughnuts . Not for me .
One star is for good drinks Food was very disappointing . Scarcely any beef on philly cheese steak . Hamburger toppings not as described . Soggy chips
Do you like Applebee ' s ? This is " Mexican Applebee ' s . " Charlotteans will eat and rave about pretty much anything , it seems .
Disappointing - service was very slow , the food was unexceptional . I think we got the " B " team on Sunday .
Food is awful . Seating arrangements it is like you are sitting on top of people and you could hear all conversations .
Your basic greasy spoon breakfast served with heaping helpings of Fox News and conservative rage .
Dont come here everything from the food to the service is nasty . From the manager to the hostess and dont want to get me started with our server .
this place was pricy and everything was so salty . the worst shushi place i ever been to . stay away ! never give reviews but cant really stand the terriable taste .
Second time I ' ve tried to come here . They close at least half an hour early . Disappointing .
I reached out to this company due to all the great reviews . However , no one ever called Me to give me an estimate .
Probably the most ghetto and dangerous QuikTrip in America . The place is full of gangbangers and tweakers . One of the clerks was murdered in front of everybody just a couple of years ago .
The struggle is real at this place . Not packed , but the service is definitely driving the struggle bus . Prepare to set aside a good amount of time at this joint .
Food is decent . Having been here several times with a regular and then coming here without them , I was literally treated like trash by the employees . Mainland attitude - never again .
Tried to go October 10 , 2012 . Appears closed . Maybe renovating but not open .
Waited 15 minutes for a table when there were more than six empty tables . Ordered the brisket sandwich . The meat was touch and lacked flavor . The waitress only stopped at our table once .
Service is terrible waiting on a tow now for 90 minutes in the middle of Phoenix . Keep providing eta and keep pushing it out . Will cancel this service tomorrow !
WORST EVER ! Happy to take my money , push for the " full coverage " on spills and tears for five years , and FAILS TO DELIVERY THE COUCH !
No clue as to what good customer service means . Small limited selection and HIGH PRICES . You can do much better through mail order .
Substandard food compared to many of other Japanese places in town . We can ' t express how rude the service was and again poor food . We certainty won ' t be back .
Disappointed . First Time was excellent and second time not a chance ! Rude chef ! Didn ' t get a chance to eat because they were rude ! Won ' t be back .
The food is very average and yet again oily . The customer service is terrible as they make you wait a while for the food and bill .
horrible place there was a roach on the floor , waitresses didn ' t have their hair up . found a platinum blonde hair in my food , everything was horribly over priced c
Food was fine but the restaurant is not very clean and the staff is not very friendly
Have had fish and chips once before and they were good and not greasy , but today the total opposite . Took family there and very disappointed . Don ' t know if we will do that again .
Line dance line dance line dance . Don ' t go here if you want to dance with a girl . . . . . and put some bull riding on the monitor ' s
Tried this restaurant twice . Breakfast was not good , we tried eggs Benedict and poached eggs . And later we tried the bakery at night and the cheesecake and cookies were really bad .
We just discovered by reviewing our credit card statement that our server increased his tip without our knowledge . I wonder how many others this has happened to ? Burger was good service sucked .
Terrible seating and wait service . Seems like a training ground for new Vegas wait staff . Food was decent and beautiful atmosphere but I would stay away .
After reviewing the video tape the employee did in fact take the paint off of the car with the high pressure hose .
Pizza was very hard as was the bread . Cheesecake was good . Took one an hour and we are only a few blocks over .
We did not like the pork chop and Buffalo . The mac & cheese was wonderful . The decor was nice .
Need to get a new front desk person . Jessica was so rude . We left because of her . Asking questions she was condescending .
Overpriced mediocre food in a loud open dining area . The music was so loud I couldn ' t hear the person behind the counter , much less the person I was eating with . Not worth it .
Crappy service , mediocre food . They last straw was when they refused to give me a cup of water to go with the food I unfortunately bought . Never again .
On passe devant , on entend la musique et le connard à la porte nous indique sur un ton sec : 10 $ sinon il faut partir . Avec un tel accueil , on est partis .
S _ _ _ TY STAFF ! This is not even operated by UNLV . have the university students help out with the function , not an outside company !
Tiny little place that serves extremely watered down drinks . Super expensive . Would not recommend this place .
This location is always hit or miss . Normally they don ' t give the sauces you request which is annoying . But this last time as you see in the picture they really got my order wrong .
Your better of going to a show for the price of the dinner . Food was a disappointment . Entertainment is ok . Overpriced overall . I rarely give reviews but this place is a joke .
Not worth the drive . Nice service but the food is over priced . Air conditioning not working properly , and it was WARM !
Skimpy All wrap and hardly any filling . Chicken burrito - see if you can find the chicken .
Meh over priced . Wait time takes too long . They are trying to be a upscale fast food but food is mediocre
My credit card was charged $ 10 above the amount I signed for at this Grimaldi ' s location . I suggest you check your credit card statement to make sure your charge is accurate .
Terrible BBQ ! ! ! ! I will never eat at a Famous Dave ' s again . Horrible flavor and even worse sides . This is the worse BBQ I ' ve ever had .
This was the worst buffet I have ever been to in Las Vegas . The pasta and desert were good but the quality of everything else needed to improve .
The pad see eew tastes worse than a lean cuisine .
I ordered Sweet Sour Chicken , the portion is unbelievably small , chicken is dry . Asian Cafe is a much better deal as far as value and flavor .
Horrible service . First time to a cafe rio and felt like a bother to the staff . They were incredibly rude and cold . Will not be returning to this location
Big joke . Waste of time and money . Worse lines than Disneyland . They only had half of the games open and working . Biggest disappointment ever .
It really is challenging to be patient when you would like some professional help buying a dress suit and there is 1 salesperson for the entire department .
Oxtail has no taste was extremely watery and such a small portion for almost 12 bucks ! Their jerk might be good but the oxtail was HORRIBLE !
Gil - con . They con you , dumbass ! make u drop off u Mower for two weeks and nothing ever happens .
it smellz like poop and the workers have sex behind the counter
Three times ate there with my family three times went home vomiting ! ! Over priced ! ! Rude customer service . . Wow get real rinaldi deli ! !
We wanted to sit outside and enjoy dinner but they have a stupid band that starts at 8pm . Way too early . What a waste
Absolutely horrible ! Service bad , food worse , stay away ! One of worst restaurants have ever been to in Cleveland . Mothers Day brunch - epic fail !
Don ' t even bother . Better to take a direct route taxi than wait 200 years for this garbage . Do anything else but this or weak Super Shuttle . The worst .
We sat on the patio . The food and atmosphere was great until the people at the table beside us started chain smoking , which the wait staff didn ' t seem to care about .
Terrible service ! Dirty table , menu , cutlery and cups . Recycled ( or appears to be ) , tasteless , crappy quality food . What else can be wrong ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
The only good thing about this place is the taste of the green salsa . Other then that the workers were rude and I wasn ' t able to get extra chips without paying
The only good part was the hostess jokes . The food was cold the fries were stale and I ' ve never been so thirsty in my whole life . I ' m very unhappy .
I really can ' t believe people love this place . The service is good . But the food is so bland . I had a foot long chilli cheese dog . . . blech .
The exchange rate was terrible . I handed 30 american dollars and received less than 32 dollars ! And the real exchange rate is 1 . 25 ! ! ! !
If you ' re in a hurry , do not stop at this location , long drive - thru wait . . . really long , waited 15mins for food . Time of visit : 10 : 40pm
Beware Aetna does not provide a list of drugs it covers , so your drug may not be covered . You won ' t know when you sign up . They ignore questions asked to them .
Foods ok . Service sucks ! So many servers and none come to help out . Hostess was to busy texting to acknowledge us until the photographer told her she had people .
Cox cable was here for six hours today . I had phone troubles . By the end of the six hours they had not only NOT fixed my phone they had broken the Internet . Arghh .
Not impressed , Salsarita ' s was so much better .
$ 4 . 80 for a breakfast sandwich seems a bit much to me given what you get . Outside of that the place was acceptably clean and seemed decently busy .
當前台告訴你要等五分鐘的時候，如果你不是白人，準備好等三十分鐘。One word for the ladies at the front : unprofessional .
I terminated my relationship , yet AAA is like a psychotic ex , stalking and harassing . Is it that hard to honor my request to STOP CONTACTING me from over two years ago ?
My husbands food came 1 hour before mine . Management really didn ' t care , said there were other sushi orders ahead of mine . We will NEVER go there again .
Good food , silly name , SLOW SERVICE . Came on a Saturday night , there was no wait . Chips are fresh and delicious but after the food came our server was MIA .
Slowest Starbucks on the planet . And , employees seem completely unconcerned . Avoid at all cost ! !
Horrible service . . . . No attentiveness . . . Mediocre / cold food . . . Did not feel welcome .
Went here for half price wings on Wednesday . I ' ve never seen such miniature wings in my life . Was really disappointed .
WAY overpriced ! ! Very snooty . Hostess was one of the worst I ' ve met . Not at all worth the money .
Maye Heating and cooling has been bought out by Morris / Jenkins and is no more .
Went on a Thurs night when it was pretty quiet . The mechanical bull was on but it wasn ' t put to good use . Average sports bar . Average priced mixed drinks .
Food was terrible the chicken in the chicken platter was rotten . The salad was drowning in Cesar dressing . One great thing is the order came really quick . Not good at all
The waitress was a real b * tch , really rude I ' m surprised she still works there . Never going back .
Went for lunch and we all ordered Carne asada burrito . Food was plain and overpriced for what you get .
Seriously . The stinkiest office of all . Jam packed with people we waited for over an hour . The doctor didn ' t listen to anything that was said . It was awful .
Old & dirty . No air in elevators . Never got clean towels . Pool hours are 9 - 6 . People like to swim at night ! ! !
Below standard , even for Chipotle . Rice was not cooked all the way . Food was lukewarm . Salsas were flavorless ( maybe not fresh ? ) Pretty disappointing .
The staff here is very rude and has a sarcastic attitude when asked simple questions . Although they have nice Swaroski crystals , they are very pricey and not worth the attitude you get while shopping .
Had the Colorado lamb chops for dinner . Had violent vomiting food poisoning overnight .
Didn ' t like the smashed potatoes . Found them oily . Also the restaurant is tiny and uncomfortable .
I feel thoroughly annoyed by the amount of food that I got for $ 21 . The salmon that you see here was $ 7 add - on .
The waitress was rude . Rolled her eyes at us . Kept looking down at us and service was slow . Her attitude was horrid . Do not go . The manager was no help .
I ' m torn . . . The boba is so good but last night I saw an employee handle food without gloves on . . . Yikes : (
My last few trips had been rather disappointing . The portions have gotten smaller with the prices increasing . The quality of food is very nice , but for the cost you could do better .
Place absolutely has nothing on way of selections waste of time and gas money and there bdu pants are made in China f that
Good food and great employees , but the facilities are trashed . This place needs cleaning and maintenance . The front window has been broken for weeks and the other windows are filthy . Clean your investment !
This is the filthiest Circle K I ' ve ever seen ! Especially for the location ! Our usual one gets 5 star !
Disappointed in Black Bear today usually the food is really good but today the bacon was overcooked the toast was soggy and the potatoes were hard
The order was wrong and we asked for nacho cheese fries and got shredded cheese on our fries . We also waited a long time for our food .
Not worth the price . Horrible massage . I am kind of glad it was a gift card . I didn ' t use my own money .
I wanted a vegetable yakisoba and was told that I would get charged for meat and so I asked for it on the side and they said no and I still had to pay for it
There was this cashier that ' s shit rude , and ended up getting my drink wrong anyways . Lol why is she always there when I go .
Great coffee and customer service but homophobia is the disease of this Country and shouldn ' t be mixed in with a pleasurable thing such as coffee .
This casino was crappy . Apparently you only get free NON alcoholic drinks while playing . Good way to keep people playing . Will not return .
We just got to go . The sesame chicken was really overcooked , I couldn ' t even finish it . Would not recommend .
The worst panda express for food . The food just taken home was greasy and no flavor . Very little selection here . Horrible food for taste and done
Sadly , an entire waste of time and money . VERY disappointing - especially with no offer to make anything any better . Will not recommend .
WORSE service I have ever received in a restaurant . Food was just ok .
The burgers have NO flavor - The zuccini is good - The 2 chicken nuggets for $ 5 on the kids menu is a rip - off ( soooooo tiny ) .
The elevators were broken except for one . The check in line was ridiculously long . The room was ok besides having spider webs on the ceiling above the bed . I wouldn ' t stay here again .
This place will not support a real rotation for Karaoke unless you pay $ 20 dollars this place sucks . . . . .
They need to hire some help or something . You shouldn ' t have wait 30 + minutes to get a couple sandwiches even if it is 2am . It ' s called fast food for a reason .
Service was good but pizza was awful . . . dry , scant toppings & it took forever to arrive . I ' m missing Nello ' s already .
Soggy french fries , an okay burger and that ' s about it . Oh , and it will cost about 10 bucks .
Food has deteriorated and service at this location isn ' t great . The manager has no clue what ' s going on in his restaurant . There are way too many choices to come back here again .
Office staff do not have good customer service . Do not recommend .
Not very good , I ' m shocked that this place had so many stars . We recently moved to the area and are looking for amazing sushi , this wasn ' t it .
Rude employees especially the lady at the scheduling desk . Its a doctors office people . We come in sick and dont need the BS from employees .
Used to be the best car wash however now it barely washes your car as it ' s a 3 inches to high and barely touches car . Time to find a new spot .
Overpriced ! ! ! ! $ 25 to shorten a hem on a summer dress . She charges more than I paid for dress !
Called for pricing front desk wouldnt give any information or offer an appointment to check it out nor offer a paas . A bit rude !
Very disappointed in the food , should have went to chipotle across the street . The salsa dishes are thimble size .
The pretzel app was great , salad good , but the pizza is completely lacking . The sauce is basically tomato paste .
Food was not that good . Did not get our orders correct . Lacks seasoning and flavor ! There are definitely better places to go !
Love the food but have had multiple orders made wrong . Both when ordered over the phone and in person .
This is the worst service I have ever had . . . . I think I ' m done doing business with BoA .
Not open even though hours say they ' re open at noon on Sunday . I ' m an out of towner so it ' s unfortunate that I was unable to shop .
This place was better when they had their soft opening . Got the beef udon and the miso broth was somewhat bland . The noodles were not freshly made .
If I could choose a half or quarter of a star , I would do so . Do not waste your time or money with these people . Management is horrible .
The food is great but I don ' t think I ' ve ever experienced worse service .
They didn ' t deliver the package to the door as they were supposed to . We were home all day . No note was left at the door stating that they even attempted delivery .
The pizza wasn ' t that great at all and neither was the weird garlic bread . Wouldn ' t recommend at all .
Only thing going for this bar is the little person that comes out and feeds people shots . Otherwise , typical bar that allows smoking .
I wouldn ' t recommend this place to my worst enemy . It would only be worse if I get explosive diarrhea on the airplane , in which case I might reconsider recommending it to my worst enemy .
My friend took his car to this place and they did a bad job on the headlights and then they stole all the floor mats and I don ' t recommend this place to anyone .
Worst hotel experience ever . Just spent an hour calling - in their hotel room . ruined vacation . I ' ll tell everyone I know to stay away from this hotel ! Thank you trump .
The sushi is good but you only get 5 - 6 rolls . The hibachi isn ' t flavored but the mayo sauce is good . The music is great . Friendly servers .
This Mcdonald ' s sucks the food looks awful there ' s bugs everywhere but the good thing is that it ' s pretty big so you have space to eat .
My steak left a lot to be desired . Well prepared but mediocre flavor . Full disclosure my gf is a big fan .
Too many tables . . . you sitting on top of each other . $ 3 . 00 regular coffee ? Ridiculous ! No Senior discounts . Expensive Breakfast menu .
My standards are reasonably low considering that I got my dinner from McDonald ' s , but their food is flat out NASTY . No vegan or vegetarian options .
Shipped a box with a pre - paid UPS label and this store charged me a $ 2 " tape fee " to put a strip of packing tape on the top of the box . Seriously ?
Terrible service even though the food is decent . My phone was also stolen here tonight . Not sure this is a family place like it used to be .
Very bad services charges for ranch and manger sitting there doing nothing really I had to wait ten minutes for my order
Room is OK but the floor is dirty . Wireless works fine but the building is full of bad smell . Be aware of $ 12 . 99 resort fee !
Waited for five minutes for someone to acknowledge me . Go to Target on Blue Diamond , much more helpful !
Absolutely horrific set - up . Takes at least an hour to get drinks on a busy night ( like tonight for Dustin Lynch ) . Will NEVER come back . . Ever .
This place is just ok to me . Been twice now and no need to go back . If you want great Korean food , try Tofu Village on Bloor .
This place basically sucked and was expensive for Mexican . There are so many better places . It ' s the most basic of basic Mexican food . Bland . Boring .
the worse boba I have drunk in My entire life ! Never going back again Very unprofessional
Treated me like an idiot over the phone , kept interrupting me to yell at his empolyees .
Quantity over quality . When it comes to sushi and seafood , a buffet is definitely NOT the way to go !
Service is typically inconsistent and food is over priced . The bartender typically overpours your drinks so if you ' re looking for something strong . . .
New look same average food . I miss the old place where they could at least keep up with the customer ' s food and drink orders .
The wait time is insane . 4 hours then the doctor comes in " listening to reply not listening to understand " this place is a joke
Staff was rude . Only had smoking rooms . Tried to add on extra for parking . Not a good place .
This guy is immature , failed to follow up with service and left our unit running without a filter . I would stay far away from this business . There are far better professional HVAC companies
The slowest Starbucks ever ! ! It ' s the closet to my house but so slow all the time ! Doesn ' t matter if you are the only person in line .
Manager was a horrible person to deal with . Did not want to help me out at all . Horrible customer service .
Go for beer . Nice staff . Just don ' t eat anything . Terrible food . Cold . Not edible . Had to send it back Should have looked at yelp prior .
Rude clientele and wait staff , no wins here ever since Jacks took over ! I will go to the hard rock thanks !
Chips feel stale , and the carne asada was dry and chewy . Black beans were bland , and the cilantro rice had little flavor . Skip this place .
Falafel was very bland and a doughy consistency . The kafta was strangely encased like a sausage and also bland . The beef shawarma was edible . Could do better . I ' m very disappointed .
No bathrooms I have to live because I have two babies plus I ' m a look at the wood in the line
Horrible old hotel . Tobacco smell in the room . No free wifi . Old elevator and confusing parking . Never come again .
I love el pollo locos you guys have the best chicken ever but then your crew seems likes to love charging people a little extra without telling costumers about it especially with that drive thru .
The worst , sugar free will give you stomach cramps unbelievable . I order four for Thanksgivings and all were a disappointment
Nasty stuff . One of the worst shawarmas I ' ve had in Mississauga . The toppings are bland and the chicken made me nauseous .
The worst service and way to expensive . 30 $ for 2 burgers a order of fries and 2 drinks ! ucking rip off ! Terrible terrible terrible
These little jerks have the worst online ordering system . Good luck getting orders from anyone online .
Went here after hearing great things . . . Left empty handed as apparently they don ' t serve decaf coffee . Disappointing .
The food was terrible and was expensive bad service and excetera I will not go there again
The signature duck confit pasta was extremely salty to the point of being almost inedible . However , the service was good and the waiter helped us choose a great bottle of wine .
Terrible rude people ! ! Will never go there again and ripped me off too ! ! ! Dough was hard and cheese tasted terrible . Skimpy on the pepperoni .
Terrible service food is not worth the wait . Go to rudder Owner was onsite and rude I had shrimp and scallops 3 of each for 23 dollars don ' t waste your time or money
Why is your chicken so salty and your fries so soggy . Been in with CNJ in Pickering and Scarborough , but all seems the same .
I ' m sure that not everyone will have this experience but tonight i am alone in a hotel in Wisconsin in food poisoning agony due to this food . Not recommended .
Usually a nice spa . . . Today my therapist decided not to come to work I guess . Waited in my robe in the waiting room until my friends massage was done then got dressed and left .
Rude barista . Just keep those comments to yourself . If you ' re overwhelmed and angry don ' t pass it along to your customers .
Good food but service wasn ' t that great . Had to leave the restaurant before eating the cake , and the cake wasn ' t frozen properly , ended up all melted in the bag .
Service here varies on the person and day of the week . Food always looks like it was microwaved . So awful . Only reason I gave it two stars was because of the drinks .
If the long wait durning a slow time wasn ' t bad enough , the burger was a mangled , unattractive and straight average - tasting mess . The upside was that the fries were solid .
Not impressed at all . . . actually kinda disappointed with the results compare to how much it cost me : ( doctor was very nice and patience with me through out the procedure though .
Service sucks , way to overpriced , and food honestly is not that amazing . . I tried it a few times when i stayed at planet hollywood . . And i wasn ' t to pleased .
Have yet to hear a good experience with their service . With so many options in Charlotte , take your money somewhere else that actually treats guests well !
Run of the mill breakfast place , mediocre food . Lots of other places with better breakfast options .
Waffles are small and not worth the price you pay . You are also asked to tip before you have received any service .
Way to expensive and the decor needs to be upgraded , you can find much better pizza and pasta at some other locations in the south hills . .
The bouncer will not let you in with a valid out - of - state id . Beware .
As long as you order off the menu and have no special request like hold the onions you ' re fine apparently the cooks aren ' t skilled enough to hold the onions on a grilled cheese
Was looking for a good southern experience . Food was ok nothing special . Service was a little slow for only 5 people in the place . Was a little disappointed .
I went there to eat some veggie dog and fries and I was extremely dissapointed . The service took quite a while and all I got was old barely warm fries , and the hot dog were uneatable .
The customer service here is very poor . Trying wish they would get better management and better employees . This business has lots of potential but unfortunately is run very poorly .
I picked a vegetarian dish and lettuce had that musty mildewy not washed properly taste never again
If you want to wait in line for horrible overpriced food and bad service here is the place . Do not go here .
Dissapointing . The brushes were to harsh , and put to much pressure on the car . The chemicals are also harsh and leave the paint striped of any protection . I do not recommend this car wash .
Always long wait in line to pay . Never enough cashiers . Terrible . Excellent prices . Very messy store . Need more merchandise in scrapbook department , too many empty displays and shelves . Employees not helpful .
The service was good . The one roll we had was mediocre at best . The hibachi and everything else was not good . Expensive and definitely not worth it !
Not so golden . Be very selective what you eat . Steak was good fresh of the grill and vegies
Very impersonal ! I will never forget my negative experience at this bagel shop . They act as if you should know what bagels they have and how their place works .
vegetarian pho made with beef broth . that ' s not vegetarian . try again .
Tried twice weekdays night , sashimi & sushi were not as fresh as weekend !
This place is shit . If you are in Barrett don ' t live here . You are paying way too much and they will milk you for your money .
Worst customer service ever ! Don ' t go there ! They don ' t respect quebec ' s law and they are overrrrrrpriced on everything
Horrible service , slow and no consideration . They automatically charged tip without telling our party . Food portions overpriced for the size and quality .
I will only come here for the house margaritas . I ' m not a fan of the food here .
Well I just left Whataburger they had no soda . And all they did was bring up all my items separately and it was just as expensive without the drink . Worst experience at Whataburger ever .
Horrible place . Do not go there thoughtless not caring people . Maybe it might just be billing but she far I will never ever go back .
It ' s January second . Why are you out of Winter Dream for the year already ? ? Why not rename it December Dream ? Geez .
Stale , frozen , burnt , flavourless , pedestrian . Rude staff , rude customers , ugly restaurant . This place needs to be condemned .
Perhaps one of the worse buffets on the strip . The food selection is slim not only that but the quality of the food was just as bad .
RATS ! And mice . And 100 % occupancy , so Greystar Management will not remedy . Why should they ?
Meh . Just meh . In a town like this full of authentic , homemade Mexican food this place has no chance .
Surprisingly slow and understaffed . I waited half an hour for the lunch combo and wasn ' t informed that it was ready .
Horrible customer service ! ! ! Don ' t tell guests that they can check in early to make them wait until 4pm to get the room ! ! So stupid ! !
Ok , but just ok . Dr . Laffa , 3 minutes ' drive away on Clark Ave . and Hilda is leaps and bounds better .
Don ' t waste your money $ 10 plus for a plate supper dry dry dry brunt burnt really nasty save your money go somewhere else . service was good
Great coffee but very unfriendly and arrogant service from some barristers .
Valerie offered poor customer service . This is the second time I have been and every time bad customer service . I will not be returning
Slowest drive thru in the world . ! ! ! I have been here for 10 minutes already . I evan had tine to login and write this review ! ! !
I came here because this site told me it was open until 10 pm and it ' s 9 : 30 and they are closed somebody needs to update the correct times wither its subway or yelp
the Sandwich had too much mustard on it . . . place was empty and service was just okay . . no more kids eat free on wednesdays which was why i went there
Ug , never had been , never will go again . It ' s a sad thing when Taco Bell is better than something .
Restaurant type rôtisserie de bas de gamme . La nourriture est bonne , mais pour le même genre je recommanderais scores plutôt . Par contre le décor est beau !
Very hard to get a hold of and didn ' t even return a scheduled phone call when reached . Gave up after a few attempts and went with another service .
Nobody has gotten back to me . Kali had asked me for the server name and ticket number several days ago but , I haven ' t heard back .
Had chicken shawarma over fattoush salad . Chicken had cartilage and skin it was disgusting . I guess that ' s what you get when you have non Lebanese ppl running a Lebanese restaurant
If you are depressed and want to drink come into the tally Ho and feel very depressed very gloomy you will leave more depressed than you walked in
Service and decor were ok but food was medicre at best
Took literally almost 30 minutes to get my peppermint mocha using the drive thru . . . Longest one in my record ! ! !
Terrible service ! Employees Not knowledgeable - poor training - not the same Menu as the other locations ! on the positive , HUGE Portions & food was good
It ' s decently priced and the food is authentic . The quality of their products could be double checked though . My delivery experience from them was a bit of a pain .
Came thinking we could have a shake and frys , expecting to get refills on our fries was told they were franchise and they didn ' t Jane to follow the rules .
Tonight my bf and I was here the service was alright the buggers was good the fries was a bit over cooked
This place is disgusting , just killed about 10 little roaches in the kitchen . Hair and bugs in the bathroom , a used bandaid under the seat cushion . Stay away , far away ! Yuck !
Six months later , I am still disgusted . I won ' t eat scallops . Thank you Biltmore for ruining a crustacean species for me .
terrible service . terrible workers . don ' t go here at all .
Permanently closed ? Went to address listed here , nothing there but empty suites . No answer on phone listed when called , guessing they went out of business and are closed !
Ehhhhh so so tried to up change $ 2 bucks when I asked for a drink on the rocks . Burbon sour $ 16 ! ! ! ? ? ? ? Food Ehhhhh ok good chicken wings wow .
Went for the first time because I had a coupon . I got a manni / pedi . Went on a Thursday by Monday my nails looked terrible . I ' d never go back
This place sucks . They don ' t have dollar drinks ! ? ! ? ! ? Wtf they obviously don ' t want my business . I will not be returning . # gocheckthebathroom
just in that plaza to drop off @ UPS store galaxy is gone another one bites the dust
I asked for " Military Surplus " . Not only rude but unable to listen to simple questions . Looks like they couldn ' t bother stocking a shelf before opening .
This place is garbage . Manager DALLAS Sucks but the crew was under average . Take way to long for such a simple wash
They talked the entire time during our massages , and tried charging us $ 35 - instead of the $ 20 that was advertised . . . . NO Good Foot Spa !
Horrible customer service . Servers were rude and got our order wrong . We will not be going back . The food was decent but not worth the hassle .
Moldy air with beer that tastes like the tubing has not been changed in a while . After not getting service at a table , one of the bartenders was nice tho .
Do not go there . Food was good don ' t get me wrong but our waitress after we left the restaurant reprinted out our receipt wrote a larger tip for herself then forged my girlfriends signature .
Staff is rude , very disappointing experience . And are overpriced for the quality of food they serve . Will never come back to this place .
Horrible , I will never order again ! Salads and dressings were incorrect . Shrimp Aglio was so dry and had no flavor very disappointing !
Worst customer service EVER . Thank god I spend my 10k somewhere else . Glad they only got $ 250 out of us for my ring . Could not care less that we were customers .
This place ' s food is horrible . I definitely would not recommend it . The food isn ' t cooked properly and tastes poor in quality .
The restaurant and food is nothing like what the commercials portray . The service staff was very friendly and helpful .
This place takes wayyyyy to long . Usually Starbucks even when they are busy are quicker .
They don ' t deserve one star . Waiting forever for rental car booked months ago . Horrible ! if you have time to burn on your trip , you can come here !
Worst pizza place ever . The pizza slice is very hard to chew . I think they must put it for more than one day . It ' s cheap but tastes horrible .
sucks . My friend recommended this place for me . But I found it not tasty at all . Tastes weird . . .
Smells somewhat fishy by the sushi bar . If you know about sushi , you ' ll know this is not good .
Booooo bed bugs everywhere . DO NOT LIVE HERE . Staff here lies and not helpful .
We walked out ! Waiting 15 min to order when the restaurant is empty is unacceptable . Brought our business to Denny ' s . Too bad as this would have been our 1st time to Bob Evans .
This location never has enough staff , takes over 15 minutes to get a sandwich , a / c was out and their credit card machines were down . Corporate should visit them .
If they had a - star this would be my rating . The threading was painful and she ruined my eyebrows . I have been threading my eyebrows for years and never had such a bad experience .
Old location was great and had character . Now it ' s overpriced , average food and ambiance is lackluster .
Old dry chicken burrito . Made with no love , nor customer service in mind . Find another place . . .
When you order nuggets and it ' s as big as your thumb : ( has happened more then once now . Seems like their meals are getting smaller and smaller
The service was slow bad and just unfriendly don ' t go here . I sat for 49 minutes just waiting for my food .
Greasy food . Bad fried rice . Fast , friendly service . Annoying TV playing court reality TV . Affordable . I will not be back .
Fair play to the owner who contacted me to make things right the next time I visit . With that kind of attention to customer experience I am sure this place will succeed .
was really excited to try a new mexican spot in downtown phoenix . but when i arrived restaurant was CLOSED . it was only 4pm . site says open till 10pm .
Well if you want crappy service , then this is the Dunkin donuts for you ! My coffee crunched , IT was so sweet and disgusting ) ) ) :
. . . I need a washer and dryer . Badly . This place just confirmed something I already knew .
A little disappointed with the ramen , but it was a good size portion . Kenzo seems better .
Sat for 15 min and no one came over so i left . Slowest moving staff ive ever seen . Atleast 4 different servers walked or more like strolled by like 10x each
Worst customer service I ' ve experienced , Catherine needs to be ran off , I don ' t recommend using this particular location , others may be better . NPS off Eastern much friendlier and cheaper .
My wife loves this place , but as a lover of food , meh . . . I go to appease her but genuinly dislike the flavors and selection .
Worst place ever do not come here crappy front seat service waited 2 . 5 house short staffed but didn ' t bother saying anything to us horrible horrible place ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
It might be cheap gas . . . relatively . . . but the rudeness doesn ' t cut it . Go to Sheetz . Sheetz ' s gas is cheaper AND service inside is WITH a smile !
My juice was essentially water with a little taste of celery . Most expensive glass of water I ' ve ever bought . Will not return .
Unreliable ! Schedule a meeting for a quote to replace all windows . . . never showed up or call .
Service is slow been there 5 times in the last year nothing has changed don ' t recommend this place at all
Terribly slow slow service . . . they made an error on our bill and seemed unable to correct it .
Absolutely garbage . Do not waste your money . Overpriced underdelivered worse than a McDonald ' s in the worst ghetto of the USA .
Completely unimpressed . . . look at the pictures they speak for themselves . Oh . . . and it took an hour to get a car that was moderately clean .
The service was amazing . I wasn ' t impressed with the food . I ordered the seafood and grits . . . hated it ! The Thai Calamari was okay !
This company is a scam . They stole my security deposit and went belly up a week after signing my lease .
This place has gone way downhill since it was Mix : shitty drink menu , couldnt even make a chocolate martini , and no beers on tap . What are you offering ? ?
Drove from the west of the valley , arrived at 10 : 00 am . Hung around until 10 : 10 and it was still closed . Not worth the trip .
Absolutely horrendous service . I waited almost an hour because the first shuttle didn ' t show up . I hope no one has to go through what I went through today .
Gas is always higher here than the store directly accross the street and the auto shut off malfunctioned on me today using pump # 4 and proceeded to get gas all over my car , the ground .
DONT COME HERE . You ' re going to wait 20 + minutes to get an incorrect order . I will never come here again . You ' re bad , and you should feel bad .
Their stuff is usually reasonably priced - especially with a sale - but the quality is inconsistent . I ' ve had defective items that crack and rust shortly after purchase but they won ' t replace product .
Food was ok . Waiter was great . The bad was all of the dust on the lights and frame work of the ceiling . Geez , people ! ! Clean every now and then
Worst hotel . Just checking in was a horrific experience . Over half an hour to tell us they don ' t have a room ready even though we paid for it
This store is usually understaffed . It is the second time I left without making my purchase . Boca Park seems to have more staffing at the busy times .
Burger was average . Fries were good but the chili cheese fries were extremely disappointing . Best way I can compare it is to the chili and cheese you can get at a convenient shop .
Below average food and service . Won ' t visit again . Way too costly for the quantity and service .
Eh this place isn ' t my favorite . I got their Thai Tea Boba and the tea just tasted meh to me . I love boba and this place was just is not my favorite .
I don ' t think this place knows what Asian food is . We had 6 items and all were terrible . You could microwave frozen boxed food that had more flavor and texture .
Chicken noodle soup was beyond greasy . Could ' ve been delicious but I could actually feel the grease on my lips after a spoonful .
Very rude service . I give it another star because their food is good . Rude service knocks it down by a lot ! ! !
Inferior to all other Vietnamese places in Pittsburgh . Vermicelli noddles were not vermicelli . Poorly packed pho spilled 1 / 4 of the container everywhere . Egg roll was more like a Chinese egg roll .
Worst Olive Garden ever ! ! ! Bad service , server spilt drinks on our table , brought out wrong food , left a order off the ticket
Sorry just terrible Service . Freezer burnt tasting food . No refills after we asked . Held us captive to get our check . Just not a great place . Incompatible to other franchises .
The dishes were so blank . Falafel was good though . Other than that the buffet was a disappointment
This is a cafeteria , very out of order , serving irregularly , noodles are very soft , like overcooked , and very small bowl of noodles , I do not recommend this cer
Pretty upset that I bought a round trip ticket but I was told the return shuttle was full and they only have shuttles every hour ugh . What a waste of money
These people never answer their phone ! What ' s the point of them having a number if they can ' t answer any calls !
Service was good . Breakfast was to much and under cook . The pancakes , are huge but not cooked throughout . Taste gummy ! Nice restaurant but will not eat there again .
20 minutes for two chicken tacos . And two orders came in after me got their food first . Under new management . . . Right . . .
Food was okay Prices average Place was dirty looking The service was however very friendly
Horrible ! ! The manager just told us they don ' t take visa gift cards ! ! Seriously ! ? Don ' t come here ! ! Do not recommend ! ! !
Should have read the reviews before coming here . Lied to me about the quality of the oil in my oil change . Wouldn ' t refund $ 10 to make it right .
I love starbucks but since the only thing i drink is discontinued i will never go back again . Bring back the VALENCIA ORANGE ! !
The service sucks here . You wait 30 mins for your 2nd order including bill . My first time here but will never come back .
This is probably the worst Chipotle in the country . Unbearably long lines , poor service , dirty . It is reliably 100 % poor every time . Well worth the drive to a more distant Chipotle .
Update : My gel nail is chipped after one day . Such a waste of money . This business is truly the worst and hopefully it goes out of business soon .
Chicken was soggy and tasted like fish , teriyaki bowl bland , and ordered $ 30 worth of food to go - and no utensils or napkins . We won ' t be back .
Worst service ever experienced . Waitress was high ( seriously ! ) . Now I know how the patrons on hell ' s kitchen feel .
I have tried the subscription for 6 moths , half of the time I didnt get the complete edition delivered .
The flavor was pretty bland and excruciatingly dry . The sushi tasted off . The one good thing is the dessert counter . Mini doughnuts had me at hello .
Was hoping for more but got much less French toast was gross . Breakfast options are a joke . Coffee isn ' t terrible tho and the bread samples where good .
No one in this Southwest , the doctors are too much in a hurry . Too many patients and not enough time . THANK YOU
What a joke of a nightclub . Don ' t make reservations for bottle service or put yourself on the guest list it obviously doesn ' t matter
Depressing beyond words . The service wasn ' t bad but again , depressing . The food was fair and that ' s being kind . The over all feel had me rushing to escape .
Gross food horrible parking .
Horrible management . Very inconsistent and rude . Lived here for 4 months and found a home for a better price and a lot more nice .
Terrible service , attitude and portions . Don ' t bother going to it . Ordered Lamb and they gave chicken instead .
Wanted to try this place . Location is not great . The food is just ok . Very expensive for what you get . I can make better for much cheaper at home .
The hotel try ' s very hard to make it look 4 Star . However the service is extremely substandard .
Flies buzzing around the cooked chicken . Employees were aware of this but did not seem to be very concerned . Go to this location if you are desperate for poorly protected and unsanitary fried chicken .
I find the food to be simply overrated . Service is okay . The table was sticky . This would be my first and last time to eat at this place .
Open till 12 is what it says online . Nope . Closed at 11 : 45 . Thanks . . . went to another fast food place and dropped $ 50 .
Sales man was so rude ! ! The rudest I ' ve ever met , told me that I was dumb and stupid . So rude .
Had the burger and fries . Burger was like eating a hockey puck and fries tasted like they were cooked in old oil . Would not go back again
Almost everything was horrible that we ordered ! The calamari was a joke . It went straight to the trash . The baklava and cheesecake were ok . We won ' t be ordering again .
This restaurant should not be recommended . The waiter and waitress here will not care your feeling . They just give you food leave . If you give their bad feedback , they will even to threaten you
This place needs to fix the air quality in hotel . When u wake up u smell like u smoked a pack of cigarettes . If u are a smoker this is paradise for u .
Good food but the price and the service was awful . 3h and 15min dinner . Make sure you have time if you go . .
I have been twice with my family and both time service was ridiculously slow and the food was terrible . Never again
Not coming back here ! Girl on phone was rude , I was overcharged , they forgot my ranch and messed up my order and their wings tasted horrible ! Avoid at all costs !
This place used to be good but now i dont find it all that appealing . Donuts are ok and every time i go , i never see a variety .
Overpriced for an order at counter place . No option to get a single fish taco . Staff great but feels like a cafeteria .
Try another location . This one is a disaster . Horribly slow . Waited an hour for a quarter dinner . Fries were in a cluster . Dressing was off . Stay away .
Didn ' t even completely file the ends of my nails smooth on a $ 15 manicure . Truly the worst manicure I ' ve ever received and I go weekly .
The girl who did my pedicure did an awful job . . didn ' t know what she was doing ; couldn ' t even paint them correctly Waste of money
Pay attention to your drive through funds to ensure your server doesn ' t neglect to give you $ 5 dollars out of your total change . My fault for not noticing until I drove off .
This is the worst bojangles ever they take forver at the drive thru . Never have any chicken ready and ever biscuit I have gotten has been hard as a rock ! ! !
This Starbucks has the slowest staff running their drive thru . . I ' ve been in line for 20 minutes waiting , hire more people ! ! ! !
One of the worst dealerships to go to . Customer service is TERRIBLE ! ! The employees are rude . Save yourself time , money and headaches and go somewhere else ! ! !
Super nice place but the waiters and cooks are so rude or don ' t understand what you ' re saying ! This place has so much potential but needs better management .
Nothing to be impressed about ! ! Upscale prices with mediocre food . The service was good and the restaurant was beautiful . Sorry won ' t go back .
Discusting is the best word to describe this dive also near the ghetto what used to be a nice area 15 years ago I ' m surprised the health department has not shit it down its filthy
It ' s ok , food fair , cafeteria atmosphere , no liquor and family friendly .
Terrible food , puny burgers that look a week old , hard over cooked chicken nuggets , a definite do not return !
Wow just wow . It ' s a Wednesday and not even that busy . Out food . 20 min wait . Trash full . Tables dirty . Huge line . What are they thinking ? ?
They contacted yelp to remove the photo of my cat wound with flesh facing out . Be aware of this place . Do not use !
Rude service . I will never go back again . The food is also modified for whites , believe me it is not Indian food . The waiters have no manners .
I went there for brunch with a couple of friends . The location is one of the best in Old Montreal , however , this brunch was a bit overpriced considering the quality of the food .
Here on Yelp it says they do takeout . I just called and they are NOT yet doing takeout . Cmon guys ! Super disappointed
Terrible service , and the food was mediocre at best . When talking to a manager afterword he was extremely rude . Definitely will not be returning .
If I wanted to deal with a bunch of kids I would go to Chuckie Cheese . A great location wasted on a bunch of kids running around while their inconsiderate parents don ' t give a damn .
Chicken kebab and pilaf rice were good . I didn ' t find the rest of items tasty . Tried this place few times .
Geeze this place is getting sloppy and cheap . Servers were short and brief and didn ' t give the correct quantities Not coming back
One of the worst pho and BBH I ' ve ever had . Football blasting on the TVs , no Vietnamese music . . . never coming back , not recommended at all !
Hard to believe an Applebee ' s in American can " t find anything else to blast except Spanish music
Puke all over the bathroom . Hair in my burger . Waitress was rude . Most disgusting place in greater Cleveland . . . .
Took 15 tries to not get a busy signal on their phone system , and their email system asks you to allow for THIRTY DAYS for a response .
Very poor service from the staff and the food was disappointing . Will not be returning .
Walked in for a manicure and waited 15 minutes and got a full set but she didn ' t even clean my nails or cuticles . Nail polish wasn ' t completely filled In nail . . disappointed .
Expensive for what you actually get . Fish was also overcooked , which is sad for a restaurant that specializes in fish . . .
Chef seems to not understand the general difference between pasta and gnocchi .
The Crepe and Tivoli village is horrible . . . the owner has a bad attitude and the service was just as bad
Does not honor the online order advertised when you Google the place . Staff not too friendly .
Should ' ve read the review first before purchasing , horrible attitude ! ! If you hate your job that much , then leave . Nobody is forcing you to work there .
Sparkletts has very poor service - filters never changed on time . They love to over charge you and accidentally never credit your account . Be warned , Sparkletts aka DS Waters is definitely NOT a good company .
Taste alright . I ordered bun rieu . The broth does taste good but no pig feet . I love pig feet with bun rieu . The one reason I came there was its open 24 / 7 .
Just order a Bring It On Burger , the meat was so dry , the lettuce was old and turn bad already ! The meat taste like cooked 2days ago and than reheat when someone order！
Employees are very un professional and not knowing on what they doing . Every time , different things by different employees . They want to inflate things to rip off your money .
This place is awefull to say the least !
$ 1 . 00 for air for your tires : ( wtf ? AND the ATM was broken
This place is closed We had stopped by this place twice . There is simply a paper sign to notify customers
Extremely disappointing - extremely long check - in line . My room key wouldn ' t work so I had to stand in another long line to obtain another key . Staff behind counter very unhelpful .
Wanted to see if this location carried the Logo board game , but it didn ' t , so I left without buying anything .
Recently to breakfast bowls have been really bad potatoes soggy less bacon and nasty eggs used to be good I guess a new cook .
Very mediocre chain Mexican food . Ordered tacos that were super dry and then got charged for aioli . Seats were uncomfortable and service was very average .
Waited for 10 mins until I finally got up to get my own menu . Then I waited another 10 minutes and still no service . 20mins in the restaurant and no service .
racists who refuse to play rap music as not to attract black people . disgusting and unforgivable .
Repeatedly knocked on my door to leave unwanted brochures in an apartment complex with explicit no soliciting signs .
Really disappointing . The Lobster roll was rubbery and soggy and just kinda gross altogether . Service was . . . new .
They don ' t have a pool . The website said they do but they don ' t . Room was clean bed was comfy tho .
This is the worst restaurant in Sun City , BAR NONE . The service is slow , the food is cold , and the management is incompetent .
Never called backed to schedule after coming to give an estimate . Have called 3 times with no response .
On a hot afternoon , they had a line snaking through the lobby and one person working the ticket counter . Bad customer service , uncomfortable seats and dirty .
Total waste of money . The selection is an absoloute joke , especially for a Vegas buffet . On top of that the food is not good ! Think hospital cafeteria food . . . so disappointed .
Horrible food ! Beer wasn ' t cold . Don ' t go ! ! ! ! Wish I had read the reviews before going .
Tired to have a drink here on Friday . After waiting 15 minutes for the waitress we left . Off to somewhere that wanted to give us service !
L
They need to learn the difference between VEGAN VS VEGETARIAN no dairy mean no cheese lame that ' s why they get 1 star
Ordered the red snapper . The fish was rotten . Owner threw me out after I asked for my money back .
Service was good . . . chicken was RAW . Calamari was the best of the entire meal . First time . . . won ' t go back .
The financial advisors at UOPX want people to kiss their asses in order to get their financial aid . They have screwed me over too many times and I ' m tired of it .
Raw chicken is never a good thing . This happened repeatedly . Very good flavors and service .
Really slow service , well over an hour wait . And I ' d have to be honest , the wings were underwhelming . Kind of small and sort of bland . Just not digging it I guess .
Food was ok but the service was terrible . We were the second table seated at 11 : 30 and it wasn ' t that busy . No excuses .
People there are rude . I would never order or have someone explain the order like I am a child . Maybe this man had a bad day ; but ruined any future encounters with this establishment
- They charge double the price of most tailors - They are rude with customers who question the price - They said they would call with the job was done . Never called .
Our first time here and no one has come to our table to ask if we need anything they are very rude
Horrible customer service I will never eat here at this dirty olive garden again waitress was rude in unprofessional
HORRENDOUS customer service . Kristi was rude from the moment I walked in the door . I used to eat Papa Murphys weekly . . . after today I definitely will not be returning .
Complete rip off ! DO NOT HIRE THESE PEOPLE ! ! ! Charged $ 500 + to put in a thermostat ! ! !
Went out of my way to come here only to find out you need and appt to get your oil changed . . That sucks ! ! !
If I could give this place a no star I would ! Sat down for twenty min and no service ? ! ! Then mentioned it manager and he had nothing to say so I just left
I reserved a non smoking room and they messed up with that , I ended up getting a smoking room and that was so gross ! ! ! !
DO THEY ANSWER THE PHONE ? ! OMG I WAS ON HOLD FOREVER . . . Online kept telling me they dont deliver to Apache / Mc Clintock but they have before . Annoying . .
Except for the pasta , nothing else on the buffet was good . The sushi was ok . The quality of the Chinese food was very bad . I would never go back l .
I ' ve had enough of poor service and bad food . Given the many shots had enough but there are other places to eat .
Neither
Hands down the worst place in Vegas . Sketchy sketchy people and you should never go here . They will still your money and act like it ' s you . Never ever go here .
Got a quote which was high and they added a lot of extra fees to their quote . Only a discount if you paid cash but price still high .
Poor food , poor service , poor experience . This place used to be great 10 years ago but it ' s not the same anymore . I would advise to visit the Dundas square location instead .
Maybe they closed . Tried to call few times , left messages but no response . Sent inquiry on the website but also left unanswered
Not a Vegas based company . Some sort of pseudo crewing service . Address is a postal packaging store .
Sadly this place is closed . Go to taco bell instead , the pepsi taste better there . The ice isnt even cold ice here . I got diarrhea for days
Not impressed . I feel like the cupcake was a bit dry . I ' m a big fan of cupcakes over brownies . I ' m favoring sweet daddy cupcakes over Gigi .
Wait 2months for App . Not a good place to use . ! ! Harmon address . This place Suck ' s . . . . . . . .
Two stars ( even though I couldn ' t be stranded too far from a bathroom for a couple of days after eating here ) for the lack of decent thai restaurants in Madison .
The worst eggs Benedict I ' ve ever had - it was more like hard boiled with cold hollendaise . Also had the nachos which were cold with congealed cheese .
Almost 1 year later and no follow up or acknowledgment from Red Lobster from my review ? Figures . . . . .
It took over two hours to get in and out with a small party . The server did not know what to do . Bad service , but the food was good .
Don ' t go their buffet , the food isn ' t fresh . . . . waste of money , bad service and will ruin your day !
I prepaid for a convertible . When I arrived , none were available . Twenty mins into expressing my frustration , a convertible became available . I waited another 20 mins for them to wash it .
Overpriced . Poor quality . Processed cheese ? Completely dead during lunch rush , which should tell you something .
This is the only See ' s store I ' ve been to that didn ' t give any samples . Couple that with poor slow service . I ' m never returning to this store location .
Good quality but pricey for the amount of food you get . Had to stop at taco bell after I ate here .
You will like this place IF you don ' t mind run down , dirty , out - dated , far from the strip & cheap ! I will not be returning . . . Ever !
We choose a chain for consistency but when the chicken is full of the part no one wants to eat it ruins the whole experience . Please cut the fat , literally !
Three words : food borne illness . Frankly , their food isn ' t tasty enough to warrant the risk .
Overpriced mediocre tapas and limited beer selection . Been to many similar settings and this would rank at the bottom . Service was not bad when we were seated but whoever greeted us was not the most pleasant .
Wasn ' t very pleased but there isn ' t much Colombian food around so I guess this will do .
This is a pathetic place with poor customer service , no public retrooms and a bad attitude . Will never purchase anything from this store ever .
Slow . Still got order wrong . Could not even answer basic questions about food . Moderately clean .
Meh . The shawarma was tasteless . I couldn ' t even taste the hummus or garlic sauce , too skimpy with it . On a bonus note , the dude at the counter was super nice .
Good price but the food was only so so . I probably won ' t go back . There are too many great places to eat in Vegas to settle .
This place isn ' t open till 2am . They close at 12 . Worst place to go too if u craving asian food
I dont understand people that rate this place more than 2 stars . I ' d go elsewhere unless you ' re drunk and just want some food .
worst place in pittsburgh . Can ' t even cook a steak . don ' t waste your time .
Food was aweful , . . . Over microwaved mosaic dip , . . . Too salty ginger curry , . . . And over cooked rice .
Now held ransom by a Touchtunes jukebox . Terrible music . Grime on everything ( controllers , tables , door handles ) . Cool beer though !
This place used to be incredible . Wow how times have changes - frozen fries , pathetic service , bartenders with boobs outs , asparagus like mush - so sad .
Fast service but this is what my Locks bagel looked like . Where ' s the cream cheese and one piece of lock .
Service was horrible . . . . Waitress came by to take order and brought us food we waited about 20 minutes before anyone else showed up to table to check on us
Have a had a good experience before but most recently was upset with my experience .
Not much info on their website . Seating was less than desirable . Show was not what I expected . Venue was ok . Overall a pricey disappointment .
They have the SLOWEST drive thru I have ever been to and do NOT have good customer service ! Never again ! Avoid this location
Over priced and nothing special . Food was bland and not very " authentic " to say the least . Just your regular overpriced generic casino restaurant .
oh now i remember why ihop is gross . . . i got the tbone steak and egg , worst steak ive ever had . . i think my daughters decent french toast was better . . .
What the hell did I just eat ? There is literally freaking hair all over my burger ! ! !
Unprofessional people , very bad management around here The food is below average nothing special
First time in this hotel , and all start slow from check in procedure to having the luggage up in the room . Toke 45 min to have our luggage .
Good riddance . Your food was overpriced , overhyped and unremarkable . And your service was the absolute worse ! ! !
Worst wifi ever . On its best day it barely works . 3 months of weekly wifi complaints an Google wifi provider can ' t get it functional
no , no , no . I can ' t say it enough . Greasy , salty fish eaten with plastic forks in an unclean setting . What else is there to say ? ? ?
The serves was terrible . The food was ok until I got home and had food poisoning . I would never go here again . . .
Worst place ! I ordered food two days ago and my daughter vomited . Please don ' t go there .
Meatball sub was raw ! Notified the store , customer service was very unhelpful ! We will never order from this location again .
Twenty plus days later and still nothing even after being told I would be contacted . . . . still the worst service place ever !
Dead atmosphere , limp everything , in attentive service with no customers as an excuse . It was cheap - ish , and I still felt robbed .
Terrible customer service . Wait in line for 30 - 40 min for everything . Line is out the door three people working at service desk . Unacceptable . Building is nice and clean .
Ordered fried chicken with green onion . Wanted bone in . . . when we picked it up it was boneless and they were unwilling to fix it . Customer service non existent . Ill stick with the fry
Food is okay . Music is ridiculously loud . You cannot carry on a conversation without yelling and after about a 40 min wait for the food , we all got headaches from the loud atmosphere
Run away as soon as possible . It ' s a very expensive place to go guys . I don ' t recommend this to anybody else .
No big deal . No great happy hour . Service is mediocre and so is the food . Drinks weren ' t bad but a bit price .
Got the wrong order one fish was cold one was warm and fries were cold and un eatabe . To many people to go back as I was on my lucnh . . . Very disapponied
Incredibly overpriced for food that was nothing to write home about . Also , Chico Malo overcharged me seventy dollars for a twelve dollar meal and took nearly two weeks to refund me .
Delivery took an hour and a half ! The potstickers were deep fried and small . The general Sao chicken was soft and chewy . Go to China Bistro way better food
Overpriced Food not that good Dirty inside Grossed us out Long wait Pamela ' s better Ritter ' s better Avoid this tourist trap
Worst dining experience ever . The waiters are very bad and annoying . First time , i refused to pay tips . Won ' t ever go back again ! !
skip unless you like pre - packaged food and rude bartenders
We couldn ' t even finish our burger when the entire thing was soaked in mustard . They do have great customer service but we ' re not impressed with the food .
Never come to this auto shop again . My check engine light went on right after an oil change here .
The worst bar experience I ' ve ever had . Bar tender was rude from the moment we sat down and it continued through out the service . Such a bummer .
This is the worst buffet I have ever had . My fiance and I had to leave to eat somewhere else because we couldn ' t eat the food .
5th time there and I was not impressed . Took a friend for the first time and service was horrific food mediocre . I will not be back . Ever
Worse ever . Rude curt scheduler . Rude employees . Don ' t use as they obviously are too busy and truly won ' t listen to issues .
It is a neat interior and good service . I tried the Bento box lunch . On the pricey side . I feel that VIP on Odana is a better place for the good and cost .
This was a disappointment . The cupcakes were dry and flavorless , and the person we dealt with was rude . They looked good but not worth the price we paid .
Usually it ' s a chill place but the bartender was a bit rude and tip reflects on your service
Not sure how anyone can really enjoy deep dish pizza . . . waaaaaayyyyyyy too much crust to eat . It ' s kind of like eating a loaf of bread . Their thin crust pizza is serviceable .
We got takeout and it was low quality Mexican . Chicken was stringy and tough , seasonings were very pedestrian . If you like this you ' re not serious about Mexican .
Bad service , didnt take our order while waiting and started with a new customer although i was there first
Wanted to love you Stevie ' s but your sauce was sour and got us sick . Pizza is okay but not 100 . I go there when we ' re in a pinch and really desperate for pizza
Levi was on his phone the whole time while " checking us out " . Horrible customer service . Where the hell is management ? !
Sold us a pair of expensive Lucchese boots that turned out to be factory defects , stamped on the inside was FD , they did not disclose this . Buyers beware !
Wanted a late night treat with my four friends . Instead we all got stomach pain after are blasts .
Why I always go to Moe ' s . How do you run out of freaking chicken at 1 : 30 in the afternoon .
Services are extremely overpriced . Facilities are outdated and in need of renovations . Staff was misleading about services covered by coupon and accusatory upon questioning . Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere !
Worst food and worst service I ' ve experienced in Charlotte . Granted , I ' ve only lived her for a year but I just had to do my part to warn people about this place .
less than average breakfast joint . If they don ' t have fresh orange juice , they shouldn ' t be calling it tutti frutti . never again
I always get bad vibes about this place each time I go in must be about my skin color because it ' s certainly not about my character because no one knows me
I came in with a valid Entertainment Book coupon , and they would not honor it . Drove 30 minutes for this BS . Beware .
That staff was super impolite to us . When they served us food , just like they want to throw the whole dish in our face . Never come back
I ' ve eaten here a few times now . Before I was celiac and after . Prior it was good . But if you are coming for gluten free food , go elsewhere .
The worst karaoke experience of my life . Does that help ? But they are hiring for a fish racing hostess . So if you are looking for employment maybe you can turn this place around .
I walked by today - white sign out front stating : 20 % FACIAL - - - just sayin '
Good ideas for menu , food preparation not well executed . Poor service , slow even though the restaurant was almost empty . Disappointing experience overall .
Positively mediocre . Stale sandwich roll and the chicken died in vain . The beer was cold and they had two local brews so at least they ' ve got that going for them .
Big neon sign says " HOT Baguettes NOW . But . . No Baguettes available . They are out . 15min wait . Buh Bye . .
Do not order the eggs Benedict . Worst ever . The home fries tasted really funky . Like they were fried in old grease . Waitress was excellent but that was the only good thing .
It was good but overpriced . . . sorry but hot dogs ? And you gave it a fancy name . . oh no never again
Decent local pub . Food is mediocre . . . beer selection is not substantial . Can get noisy and tight . Beantown Tavern accross the parking lot is better , but only marginally .
I ordered a $ 9 pre made sandwich and got a loaf of bread and two pieces of diced chicken . If you ' re going to rip someone off , a least make a somewhat passable sandwich .
The employees here are absolutely crazy and overly pushy . No matter how good the tea is ( and it ' s amazing ) , I will never go here again .
This dance store is extremely small and unorganized . Rather go down the street to Capezio !
Worst food experience ever ! Food was cold , egg roll was dried out and tasted like rubber , soup was so salty we had to add water to dilute it ! Never again !
Do not rent books from neebo . ( advertised by rebelbooks ) they try to rip you off and charge you way more once the order is placed and when questioned they said " it is our policy "
I would rather eat at Roberto ' s . . . . The food simply tastes like garbage . . Prices are way to high for their low quality food
Terrible meal , terrible waitress . Nothing good to say about this place . Waitress dumped drink in my lap , forgot 1 out of 4 meals . Would never tell anyone about this place .
Don ' t know how this place stays in business . Their prices are not good . You can do better online .
Slow . We waited 40 minutes for burger and fries . Fries arrived cold . No spoon for the applesauce , no fork for the coleslaw . The burgers are ok , worth the trip , no .
The building is beautiful the employees aren ' t . When asked how much money I was putting down one of the men at the table got up and left .
All food was blah - we had salmon and crabcakes - I would not recommend .
The couldn ' t find my reservation made by phone . Used my confirmation and it was tied to a different person and cancelled . Waiting 30 min and counting past my reservation time to be seen .
After 2 Visits here i come away unimpressed . Food is mediocre at best albeit well priced for the area . Our waiter Anthony was exceptional but the rest on the staff seemed disengaged .
Bait and Switch . . . Not ok . Dont go down this road
They have no vegetarian options for lunch . The veggie stack was a packet of salt on sour vegetables that I couldn ' t eat . The servers have no ideas for vegetarians , I mean no customization .
Overall poor experience . I asked for an " old fashioned " and the baretender seemed confused . On top of that the place was full of working gals .
Blindsided by a 33 % subscription increase without any notice is unprofessional to say the least ! Illegal ? Sorry there ' s no zero star . Possible cancellation of 20 year subscription .
The service is awful . The drinks are weak and the management wouldn ' t let us outside on the balcony . I wouldn ' t recommend this place Go to Foundation room instead .
Best chunk , manto and kaboli rice in Mississauga . But I hate the atmosphere super jungle in waiting .
We checked out this place when we were in Phoenix last weekend . The water is not very clean and my dog was not interested in getting in there .
The bartender a young white male was rude to us talked to us once and didn ' t acknowledge us once after but took care of everyone else around us . . . overall bad attitude
Service was slow , rolls were very small , not fresh and really expensive . Seaweed salad had more mixed greens than seaweed . Not impressed and not going back .
Pathetic Indian buffet I have ever had in town . Hardly any choice in the menu and what was available was also of poor quality . . . Regrets
The longest wait for drive through and lobby . If you are in a hurry or on a casual day out . Expect at least 20 min .
Service was slooooow . They were also out of about 5 different beers . the place is cool because you are on a second floor balcony overlooking the casino floor but that would be about the only perk .
I hate bullies . On you if you choose to support this corporate strong arm after its vicious attacks on a tiny retail beer shop in Atlanta .
The food too salty & taste bad， the coconut drinks add too much ice & water , can not tasted fresh coconut . The Tom yum soup too salty .
Pizza is not good Sauce taste stale Restaurant appears dirty No restroom available for the customers " go to Dotty ' s , they will let you use theirs " Disregards for sanitation
service ici ? ? ? HORRIBLE ! impoli sans raison ! je ne retournerai jamais !
Wasn ' t impressed with the fact that guys are encouraged to throw coins at the girls ! !
Ordered delivery , only reason for the second star . Delivery was fast and prompt . However the pizza was horrible . The pizza was soggy & cheese tasted like it was cheap . Never buying again !
Here for preopening day . Food was mediocre at best . No free refills on soda and no beer butt chicken . Not sure if I ' ll be back .
Not one to write reviews but goodness something is wrong with this location . Sat in the drive through for 20 minutes twice .
Food wasn ' t exciting , but at least I could buy a Magner ' s Cider .
Like the Previous reviewer stated . It seems like there is a different crew in my home each week . sometimes they do a good job but most of the time it is half - assed .
This place sucks an egg ! No smoking on an outside patio wtf ! Slow service , this isn ' t Scottsdale people , get with it !
Not a big fan . . . was out of most alcoholic beverages attempted to be ordered . Food was decent , but service was mediocre .
The food was mediocre at best for the price . My steak was not cooked properly and the side dishes were boring .
Price gouging assholes . $ 300 for 5 words in an easy font . Do NOT come here . The same tattoo anywhere else would run you $ 100 , TOPS . Very displeased with the experience .
Nothing to get excited about . Burgers were very salty . Nothing tasted amazing and they didn ' t have honey for the sweet potato fries .
Way too expensive . Too bad because the place has potential but like all the new stuff in the hood , it went OTT .
Food is very good but they don ' t know the concept of fast food . Takes way too long to go through the drive - through .
We ordered wings for take out , which they had then ready really fast , but they were horrible . Waste of money if you ' re looking for good wings .
Very salty food . All sauces used in food preparation very heavy . All food taste lost in the sauces . Soup also thick and extreamly salty .
their web site sucks for on - line shopping as well as their non - existent flyers that you get directed to . Go to MEC .
The receptionist wouldn ' t even let me book an appointment because they do not accept my insurance ? But my doctor referred me here because of my insurance . Well thanks for nothing Duffy .
This place Sucks , the lobby closes a half hour early , and they lock the people inside
Don ' t stand behind their internet pricing and discounts . Beware of this dealership bait and switch . I CALL bullsit , there is on incentive on 2019 Chevy 1500 .
While the service was above average the food was so - so . I ordered the New York Strip and it was grisly with little flavor .
Nasty ass food ! I finally tried it . Shitty service and not very nice service . They think they are " Godlike " there .
Slow to great when you sit at the bar . Not very friendly . Food took forever . Draft Beer selection is good . Only had three drafts available for growler refill . Overall not impressed
Very sad that this is what I received for bourbon chicken . The sauce was very gelatin and couldn ' t Identify a flavor . Thankfully I had ranch dressing . Last shot for this establishment
Queso dip is media oker . Cheese cake is good , the trio is good .
Update : My membership supposedly expired several months ago , and I ' m still struggling to shake their idiot emails and reminders .
Customer service on the phone was amazing but his is what we got . Extremely disappointed and still very hungry . I really wanted to write a good review based on customer service .
They need to add dark chicken curry to their menu .
Great food + Horrible service = Never coming back ! ( Deserves NO stars but was unable to leave a review without a star Nellos does not deserve for their service )
For a fast food place , it takes over 5 min to serve an order of fries . And only one more person here besides me . They are not busy .
Who doesn ' t love Taco Bell . Only problem is they forgot an item from my order which I paid for . What am I gonna do , drive back down there and say where my slider ?
If you ' re going to take an order set the right expectations , jimmy johns famed " freaky fast delivery " is not well represented by this location .
Make an appointment do not even attempt to wait like a regular human being . Took me 5 hours to register my vehicle
DISGUSTING . . . worst omlet i ever had . . . and the potatoes were burnt . . . the service was good . . i dont know how this place got any good reviews
15 dollars for two people food was not good salad was old piZza was cold pizza taste weird only thing good cinnamon rolls not worth ur money
Zeroes . . . straight zeroes . . . incorrect phone number in correct website and stole my secure deposit f * * * * * * thieves
4 / 15 / 18 panda reach out to me . Here in the comment section . I believe everything is just for show . I tried calling them but never really got an answer .
I only frequent this place cuz my pobox is here . It ' s definitely not because the workers are worth bragging about . Oh ya & I love the bums asking for $ $ $ $ .
service is really depends on your waiter , it ' s okay if you go at dinner time , before and after awful .
Now I know why this Starbucks has a low rating . It ' s busy but they don ' t have enough ppl to work the lines ! Even McCarran is better than this !
DEADLY salty & sweet teriyaki sauce in the bento box ! Nice California rolls add a star to this review .
The environment is good , very Irish ambiance , but the food wasn ' t all that great . Maybe it was just a bad batch / day .
I was really irritated because i said no cheese on my order , and the screen said NO CHEESE and ya girl with a dairy allergy got a mouthful of cheese . thanks taco bell for another explosive diarrhea
Bad selection , over priced and the owner is a racist , will never go near that store again !
I would never go back . The food is subpar and overpriced for the quality . I ' ve had better food at drive thru restaurants .
25 minute wait and I go in to use the bathroom and almost every booth is empty in the place . Absolutely ridiculous .
The hallway stairs are interesting . Is mess dog poop ? Is that a dead mouse or a rat on the first floor . People moving out in droves . Can ' t wait to do the same .
Perhaps a 2 . 75 , I felt the food was in imaginative , the menu was small , and the service was slow . I love all Mexican food , but this just felt like it fell short
HORRIBLE SERVICE - Long wait for fast junk food - girl drops cup on floor and puts it back to give someone
The dr was very sarcastic with a serious situation to me . Request a different dr hopefully this one isn ' t a bitch like her .
In a nutshell , I could have paid a blind child a lot less to do a better job . Don ' t waste your money at this place .
Nice place , food tasty but not served hot and slow service even though not crowded . But way better then service at Bedford location . Will try again .
Extremely small portions . An order of beef shank could not have had two ounces of beef in it .
Shannon is a terrible manager . Customer service leaves much to be desired . Massage was substandard . MassageEnvyBlows . com
Lazy , and relies way too much on carbs . Food and drinks are overpriced and when one menu item is a sandwich filled with spaghetti and meatballs this place is just another example of Parma trash .
I don ' t like this place . Customer service is so bad ! The black man who was helping me , wasn ' t pay attention on my problems !
I was really excited about this placed but it is currently not open . Site says its still open so that really sucks . i guess ill come bacj some ther time .
Worst service ever ! I called to get a cab and wasn ' t even able to order it because the person that answered was beyond rude
Ridiculous prices , even for Vegas . NEVER AGAIN 1 / 5 of a cup $ 7 . I should ' ve gone to Starbucks
http : / / www . abc15 . com / dpp / news / region _ phoenix _ metro / north _ phoenix / phoenix - wedding - venue - under - fire - for - violations FYI !
Everything I ordered wasn ' t hot enough and this to multiple people on outer table of 12 . Nice place tho and the waiter was nice .
I have this spot a try again recently and was disappointed again , just not enough meat for the price and not the freshest toppings . It ' s not even ok in a pinch , too bad .
Small portions and expensive . There was so little chicken in the chicken pita that I could have eaten 3 of them . Fast food atmosphere .
Not impressed . Unlike the other reviewer ; the meat was tough and gristley . Not very flavorful . Arby ' s beef dip much better . Ice tea was colored water . Fries were good
I ordered the pot roast , Mac n cheese , collards , green beans with cornbread . The pot roast and cornbread were equally dry . The sides were good though .
I went through the drive - through and I didn ' t get a straw and there was no chicken in my chicken bowl . Not coming again
too much propaganda , and most the exhibits are really weak or obnoxious , while the design of the building is very poor as evidenced by the nonutilitarian maze ramp at the entrance
Stay a way from this shit hole . Waited over 30 min for a quesadilla . While everybody else in my group got there food at different times .
Went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow .
Sports book customer service is inconsistent and arrogant . Decent food joints but nothin to write home about .
I don ' t get why people like this place . The food is very average . It consists of burgers and fries and hotdogs . Nothing to see here .
If I could give a lower score I would . Terrible service and the all you can drink special is a joke . Don ' t waste your time here .
They switched our steaks the shrimp was supposed to be grilled and was rubbery The matter did take off 50 % off from the bill and took the strip off the bill but still very disappointing experience
a real joke of a deli . canter ' s in LA should be ashamed of this undeli like snack bar . as others would say : just a sandwich bar .
Sub Par for a Westin restaurant , breakfast buffet was free which was the correct price .
Horrible customer service from front desk girls specifically , Larissa . very rude & not helpful whatsoever . Guys on the track were nice and helpful .
Wow . Jam packed with a bunch of smelly people and kids running around . Too packed to do anything . Basically walked in a circle trying to avoid crowds . Lights sucked . Long lines .
turned out it was a wheel assemble on 1 side . I ' m still using the same breaks and tires . Don ' t be bullied into unnecessary repairs and parts
between a pit bull playing chase with a cue ball and the cockroaches under the fries basket this is not only a dive bar but a hazard . be warned .
schezwan chicken i ordered was boring and not very good - too bland . wont be coming back .
This is the worst nasty expensive sandwich ever . I believe Ike ' s pay a service to give them a five star review when they open up at their stores . Too much dirty sauce on everything .
I have called this company 3 times and left 3 different messages over the course of a week . Never received a call back . I guess they don ' t need my business . Moving on .
Due to Barriques , my favorite coffee shop in town closed down because barriques drove them out of business . Way to go , you crushed my soul .
This Lowes is awful . No call and no show for a flooring quote , after I rearranged my whole work day to be available during my 4 hour window . Never again !
They served me half cooked chicken . Need I say more ? I don ' t think there is any redemption from that .
Speed in after a movie with another couple . Not impressed . Rack of ribs were absolutely torched on one side and for the portions the prices are ridiculous . Not for me .
Ordered the ribs n brisket and was disappointed . Both were tough and chewy . Not very flavorful .
It ' s September 26 , 2014 and still no resolution . Glad that my fingers still work and that I can do their work myself . DON ' T BOTHER WITH THIS COMPANY !
I would never use this salon . Made my wife an appointment there and they could not do her hair as they did not know how to do african american hair .
I eat here every day . Today I found a hair in my salad after eating a quarter of it . Pretty grossed out .
Was left on hold for over 5 minutes waiting for them to tell me if they could get Cooper Vision contacts at their location . Horrible customer service
Poor excuse for pizza . Ordered 2 toppings which were tossed on & pizza slice not re - heated . Pizza was " dry " . Service was prompt .
I wanted to try a healthier choice , so decided on their " grilled " seafood . Sorry , but not impressed since it looked and tasted like sautéed and was overly sweet .
Would not use them . They could not even get a surprise flower delivery executed correctly .
I work by this gas station and i hate stopping here there dirty and slow , and always out of Dr . pepper . . .
Bummer ! This is Kung Pao Chicken - take out with extra chicken for $ 1 . 99 extra . It ' s pretty much a regular sized order !
Worst service . Cold food . Poor management . Avoid this place to eat if you are going to a game you won ' t make it in time . Waitress had an attitude and avoided us .
After second time trying Red Rose , I ' ll pass . They charge extra for the mix in vodka . Who does that ? First experience there when Nadia behind the bar . Perfect .
Always get the Lodge cheese steak sandwich wich is good but very unconsistent lately , bartenders can be more friendly .
Horrible service and dirty facility . They always mess up my order and give me the wrong food . Poor customer service . I don ' t recommend this location .
Lets just say ill be writing corporate . The worst customer service and attitude . Never turn away a customer . And show respect . Will never visit again .
I am never ever coming back to the Urgent Care here at Southwest medical ! ! ! ! My first time here and my first experience was horrible ! And I don ' t think they even care !
The drinks taste not good for me . The tai noddles very strange flavor . The servers is good . But everything else . Like the food I ordered taste terrible . . . . . , ：（
Very bad services and the staff frowned all the time . The place very small and uncomfortable
I did call several times . . . no returned calls ever ! ! ! ! I even left emails thru you ' re website so much for that working either
Service was great and salad was good but pizza wasn ' t as amazing as I expected it didn ' t live up to the hype for my boyfriend and I : /
The apple French toast was tough and the business was more interested in their beer and red - necked patriotic symbols than menu . However , I was not charged for the dry , tough toast .
Burger was subpar and the fries were cold , didn ' t expect this from a newer place ! I may try again .
Until the owner of this business teaches his employees a few customer service skills , I ' ll take my business elsewhere .
Chocolate Cake and frosting were heavy , I prefer a lighter cake . Peach pie was not very sweet , crust was crumbly vs . flakey .
spoke with heather the manager on duty cause i ordered food last night at like 120 in the morning food was cold and hard she seemed bot to care thanks heather
Closed . Just a matter of time . Serve crappy food and abuse your guests is not a good business model .
This place is suppose to contact my Medicare & they threatened to put a restraining order against us now I can ' t even use my medical .
My friend took me here and told me it was the best Vietnamese restaurant . This really made me question his thoughts and his sanity , definitely subpar at best
Food would be worth it if it was priced in HKD
Great drinks . Incredibly rude service . Very unfortunate
Can ' t expect much from these fast food joints . But really . . . . where is the meat in these rolled tacos ? ! ? ! The service was very friendly though
Instead of writing a review , I ' m going to post a video of me wringing out a measurable amount of oil from a donut from TBC .
Horrible rotten egg stench throughout the hotel rooms . The worst customer service I ' ve ever witnessed . Housekeeping was just terrible ! Stay away from this place !
They are Incompetent and unprofessional . Did not show up on time for a scheduled event . Left a lot of people hungry and frustrated .
Absolutely horrible service and extremely dirty . DO NOT EAT HERE . There are better options .
Not what it used to be . Ghetto , bad service , gross food . And I used to love coming here , my last visit was very disappointing , I won ' t be returning anytime soon .
Hey ! I ' m owed money for graphic design work the payment is long overdue - please get in touch so that we can wrap this up . Thank you .
Unbelievable ! ! Just got another call ! ! ! Ridiculous ! ! ! ! ! Don ' t do it people ! ! Do not do it ! !
Disappointing . Not authentic . We tried the Dragon Druken Noodles and Yellow Curry Chicken . The Dragon Druken Noodles was extremely sweet and the potatoes in Yellow Curry Chicken were huge and uncooked in the middle .
Well , I guess I wasn ' t the only one who didn ' t like it ! Well I for sure wont be visiting this place anymore !
All of the dishes were bland , tasteless . Weird mix of seasoning that produces very bland food - not a healthy bland taste , but one that lacks any flavor . do NOT go here .
Very nice atmosphere but cake , tea and coffee need more improvement . Also speed of getting food and drink out is beyond too slow .
Don ' t burn my grill cheese black and still pack it up to go like it is nice . Have some pride and remake it if the entire sandwich is charred black wow
MAYO ON EVERYTHING . Literally mayonnaise on every single ingredient of my vegetable sandwich . Barely edible . Not healthy .
Tasted like a swanson tv dinner trade show . . food was tasteless and not worth the money . . . . I left hungry because everything we tried sucked
Very disappointed . They are closed for " reconstruction " . Will give a proper review if we ever get inside .
We came to bowling 45 minutes before closing time and we were refused . Great service . Thanks a bunch . I have other places to go but unfortunately you are closest to my house .
Got a burger and fries . They were low quality and very low flavor tasting food , greasy , and overpriced . Won ' t return .
Came to get a knee brace before my workout . . There ' s no store here at all . This is an office complex . Thanks Yelp ! !
Terrible service . First tables . Slow . Employees standing around . I apologize to the people who might work hard at this location but my experience on a Saturday afternoon did not reflect well .
* beware * i got a bacterial infection from this place !
Happened to a family member back years ago . That Mike Zamarripa is a total POS ! No manners , no shame they take your money and pretend they don ' t know who you are .
We eat out frequently . This restaurant makes McDonald ' s look good ! Less than average food , poorly trained personnel and bad decor . Price just above fast food but . . . .
DO NOT COME HERE FOR AN OIL CHANGE . No stars recommended . The employees pick random cars to work on , not the order they came in !
Terrible service . Called first . Twice . On hold each time over 15 minutes and through 3 employees to tell me they didn ' t have it .
The food was horrible , the lettuce wilted , the eggplant was not edible . It was such a disappointment as so many people have given it 4 stars . and the parking is unbelievable
The worst and rudest services I have ever had in the US . Had to wait long time for " on the rocks " drink and the waitress almost threw the drinks over us .
The food was great , but the manager , Tim , handled a situation with string , offensive words and manners . It made the whole experience awkward .
Service is pretty bad . Waiter running around and didn ' t know what he was doing . Drink order was completely forgotten .
By far the worst pretzles I have ever had in my life . . . stale as cardboard and obviously old . For shame rio of Las Vegas for allowing this .
Sent the steak back twice . Over cooked . This place is all hype . Go somewhere else Service is also bad .
It cheap compared to other buffets , so doesn ' t expect the world . There is a very limited selection of food . And some of it is repeated . But for the money it acceptable .
Too expensive . Also refused to take my business when asked how much he would charge for follow up work if I was not satisfied .
They try way toooo hard to be something they are not . . . . . Kinda like the girls you see wearing Juicy sweat pants in public with knock off designer hand bags !
Still trying to figure out why it says the hours are 24 / 7 but after waiting in line was told they stop taking orders at 4am .
We came here because there is a 20 % offer on yelp . We brought a large group here . This business denied our discount offer . Watch out !
1 . Warm prosecco . : - ( 2 . No wifi ( and free wifi advertised is the reason I chose this place ) 3 .
If Ditka had his smart he ' d take his name of this location . Don ' t serve crappy steaks and call yourself a chop house . Don ' t .
Great place but don ' t be in rush . . Service was so bad we switched to a new place red square Russian place and right away on it
Had the Kung Pao chicken . Expensive for the size . A few small pieces of chicken and tons of rice . Also need more vegies and less sodium .
Highly recommended by a friend but no idea why . Veggie fajitas were unimaginative and over cooked , but more importantly the service is unapologetically terrible .
Horrible breakfast croissant ever ! ! Might have had sand in it . Don ' t wast your money !
Worse service ever . Sat in line behind one car for over 15 minutes ! Part of time window person was talking with person in car , elbows bent , just chatting . . . . Never again .
Walked out due to tech yelling at young girl that couldn ' t explain what she was looking for .
Charged me 40 dollars by taking the longest way posible for what should have been a 6 minute ride he took 15 minutes
It sucked . Food was mediocre . Service was even worse . There were two waiters . I asked for water 3 times
This is the worst restaurant experience I ' ve ever had ! Not only is this place super slow in service but the food was not fresh !
We walked in and it seemed nice . However the waitress was probably the most rude person I have ever encountered . I will never go here again .
We were brought the wrong order , and the staff refused to correct it and bring us the correct item . Pretty poor service I ' d say .
Very slow . Ever time i go to this location i wait 15 - 20 minutes for a smoothie . They need to hire more help . 19 minutes today .
This location was dirty . Sticky floors . The pancit was underwhelming , kinda bland compared to other locations .
If I wanted to pay for below average Mexican food and terrible service then I might come back .
food quality is good . serving size is small . price is very high . bathrooms are filthy and cold . poor value !
The last 2 pizzas I got were Burnt they tasted bad won ' t be going back the barmaid is not a pizza maker
Place is dirty got food poison food is not good at all they don ' t make anything fresh very very bad place to eat ! ! !
Is one chicken wing 40 grams ? R u f ^ kin kidding me ? Anyway being the last time and all
Tried this fast food place when they first open up , got three ( 3 ) different tacos all was very dry . Maybe they have gotta better , haven ' t been back since they opened
I ' m not quite sure why ANYONE would go here when Smoke / Craft Burger is right around the corner and GBK is a couple blocks away
Just ANOTHER las vegas upselling tire store . . . . Successfully wasted 3hours of my Saturday for misrepresenting estimates
They have tired rooms and after changing our . Room 3 times we just gave up even though these were free nites it is not away to keep or get returning guests .
This restaurant has weird and not convenient hours . The gift shop is charming but expensive
The chicken had not been cooked properly and they didnt do anything to fix it just simply told the chef and gave me that plate
A wise person once said " If I wanted to check myself out I would have stayed home and shopped at Amazon ! Get some cashiers " and this is a true statement .
Only good thing I like about Raising canes is their sauce . . The sweet tea taste similar to McDonald ' s so nothing new . Also they don ' t accept bills over $ 100 beware
I would rather go to thai elephant or thai basil . They offer cheap and good thai cusine than this place .
Turned off by employees smoking right outside if front door . Once we pulled up , they finished their cigarettes and ran and serviced us , without washing their hands ! ! Gross ! !
This place is great if you want a mess of greasy , stringy meat soaked in way too much tzatziki . I wanted to take out my stomach and hose it off after eating here .
The doctor was nice but the office people were very rude they have no customer service skills and the hag at the front desk needs to retire we will never go back to the place
I really wish I could like this place because the people were really nice but the food was AWFUL . Literally lost my lunch , if you know what I mean . Nuff said .
Everything on the buffet was disgusting . . . ALL OF IT - go elsewhere and get quality food . Only good part was the fruit
Of all the department stores I ' ve ever been in , this is the lamest ! The selection of clothes is not very good and the staff ignores you . Pretty disappointing ! ! !
Canceled me wouldn ' t return phone calls after a year of them grooming my dogs . Totally unprofessional .
Worst service . Lame atmosphere . So many better places to eat in Cleveland including McDonald ' s . Be sure not to be too loud or you ' ll have to leave . Old people only !
Ordered 1 scoop of ice cream at grab and go window . It took 10 minutes with no one in line .
absolutely horrible customer service ! no is ever available to answer your questions . His estimate was way over what a subsequent plumber charged . This company is a rip off ! ! !
Never good when the products on the shelves have a layer of dust .
They forgot one of our orders , the food was bland , and I don ' t eat pork and when I ordered the shrimp plate without pork , somehow pork was in my food .
ugh . always crowded . . . . but they have the only smog waiver station in Vegas .
You seriously lost a customer over a disagreement of one spray tan . I guess it ' s understandable why you ' re not even at three stars , terrible customer service .
literally horrible . food tasted like it came out of a can . coupon was expired but expiration date wasn ' t on coupon . ugh 0 / 10
Horrible business . Flat rate $ 9 shipping regardless of size of order .
Try to eat here last night since it got good reviews . Just letting you know the place is CLOSED . They are expanding !
Bad ceviche I had today from there . . usually it ' s alright I can tell it was old possibly expired due to the rubber texture . . come on
The pad thai has no flavor and the mac and cheese tastes uncooked . Two stars only for the homestyle ambiance in the restaurant .
Very frustrating . Expect a long wait or to make an appointment for days later . Not very helpful when you need your phone working . Person making appointments was not very helpful or courteous .
Pizza was below average . Our order was incorrect . It took another hour to get our missing items . Nothing spectacular about this place . Won ' t be coming back .
Horrible customer service from the general manager says one thing and does another stay away - ryan farrell
Closed when they say they ' re open ( apparently this is common after looking at other reviews ) , and don ' t answer the phone . BAD WAY TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS .
Food is just so so Ambiance is very chic and contemporary . People come here more for the crowd than the food .
Horrible salesman no knowledge of the product they are selling . Bad deals rude financing
This Place is dirty filthy disgusting , broken door bad attitude rude stylist .
I ' m not sure how this place stays in business ? Awful service , poorly managed , long wait . . . the food is good but . . . ugh !
Just got Sofia pizza I was just wondering if they change the recipe the pizza just doesn ' t taste good anymore it was one of my best pizza in town but now it just taste awful
I ' ve been there a couple of time and it turns worse and worse , I love Korean food but just authentic .
The water and coffee tasted like mold . The banana muffin was mediocre , I wouldn ' t recommend it . The side of 2 over medium eggs were cooked perfectly .
Very disappointed ! I ordered chicken and broccoli and it taste just like fish . Found some hair in my rice .
10 minutes waiting for a sales person while they walked by ignoring us . Not sure how they do business while disregarding their customers . Huge disappointment .
Crooks , thieves and liars . I will never purchase another vehicle from them and will tell everyone I know about my bad experiences with them .
Jeers to you for your inaccurate reporting on my brother David Doyle . Same on you and you wonder why blood family won ' t talk to you . . . .
Avoid the drive thru at all costs - unless you have 20 mins to wait for sub - par Chinese food . And don ' t expect a " Sorry for your wait " .
Another overpriced place where you pay 14 bucks for a small plate with 7 tiny pieces of meat in which most are too fatty to eat . Great customer service . But overpriced with crap food .
The dude that drives a orange impala will tell you they ' re doing a daily close no matter what time it is on Friday . He ' s a joke
Post workout shake advertises 54g protein yet the shake only contains one " baby " scoop . Which protein contains 54g ? If they can present this to me I will purchase it .
Not very impressed - food was lacking flavor , waitress while friendly seemed distracted and forgot several items . We we ' re there before " rush " time so can only imagine service during peak hours
Worst club ever . " Airdance " no touching , just topless starting at 20 . everything else 100 + . And the girls are just standard
Pretty disappointed in this location . Ordered ranch ( . 60 up charge ) and waited over a half hour AFTER we got our food for it to come . . . asked five different times .
Order pick up no sauce not and even pie with toppings slim and Just in one place Will have to rethink ordering again
So overpriced for a mediocre cold cut sandwich the size of my fist . . . Wouldn ' t come again .
Quite possibly the worst customer service I ' ve ever witnessed . Never make the mistake from ordering from here .
Slowest sushi ever . . . And not the best one i had . Check it out If you have a lot of time . Was here on Tuesday night and place was not that crowded
Gross ! Ordered the pad Thai with chicken , basil leaf beef with sliced beef , and duck fried rice . It was all bland and was probably the most bland Thai food I have ever eaten .
Worst place ever ! Horrible customer service . The pizza took over 2 hours to get to our hotel and it was cold the mozzarella sticks were gross . NEVER AGAIN . Think before ordering from this place .
Very mediocre restaurant with expensive prices for what you get . ( Especially the scallops ) Service was good .
No drive through and their entrances are closed off . . . have to go through hotel to get in . . . lady at counter didn ' t know what the garlic glaze on the bun was
Sandwich was subpar . Staff was not helpful or friendly . The place appeared not to be maintained well .
Service is fine , food is not so fine . Lady Tremaine ' s working in the kitchen I think
Horrible service . Food was burnt and they even rolled their eyes when we tried to have it replaced . Never going back here ! ! !
Gross . Overpriced and underwhelming . Noodles were worse than top Ramon . There way too many restaurants in las Vegas for you to choose this place .
Worst service ever ! Sat at 6 : 30 , ignored for 20 mins , ordered food and never arrived . . . we had to leave for a show at 7 : 45 .
Waited for 15 minutes in prominent area of restaurant - completely ignored - left - avoid ! !
They took my money and now will not answer my calls ! Joe , Mitch and Melissa are absolutely the most shady people I ' ve ever met . Run !
go go is a no no , dinner had no taste , fried rice was undercooked and dumplings were bland and tasteless , this was a first and a last time for us
Ordered the coconut curry and my daughter had the shrimp terreyaki hibachi . The flavor for the coconut curry was very bland . The terryaki was just way to sweet . I will not be returning here .
I can ' t wait to get out of the store before I write a review . This store has zero customer service .
Not a fan . Had to go back for an adjustment for a simple men ' s haircut . While cutting my hair all I heard was how great he was at cutting hair . Not going back .
Two stars for the beverages . The food was gross . Way to salty . Long wait for bad food . Tried to get in there 3 times now . What a disappointment ! ! !
Service needs improvement ! Waiters did not come to us asking for what to order . We went to the waiter instead . No water provided . Good food with so - so : ( service .
Please do not see stylist with first initial D . I HAD nice hair before I saw her . Cut , color , all wrong . Maybe she needs to go back to beauty school !
This place sucks ! The food is nasty and the customer service is horrible ! Not once did the waitress even ask if everything was OK ! Poor excuse for Thai food !
My time where was short and disturbing . The building itself is great , someone should buy do something with it . Right now it serves as basically a barn for the dancing farm animals inside . . .
Cute concept , but the tea and scones really leaves much to be desired . I suspect the other items are much better - but come on ! A tea house starts with tea !
Girl on checkout and prep never took gloves off before touching register and monry , receipts .
Went here specifically for the carne asada fries and was disappointed . Not bad , but not exactly what I was hoping for . Might have to try something else next time .
Dirty , flys all over , waitress brought 1 menu for party of 3 and she forgot one of the orders , food was just ok and expensive . So many better Korean restaurants in town .
This hotel is just mediocre . Nothing special about it . Besides the fact that it ' s across from saks . Rooms are very clean . Beautiful views . Long check out and check in lines .
Overpriced ! Had a cheeseburger and onion rings . Rings were overcooked and the bun was kinda dry . Thr beef patty was nothing special . Wouldn ' t bother with thos place again .
I had been here twice with friends . Very disappointed . Food is alright , but the price is more impressive . Would never come back .
The worst . Terrible service & gave me food poisoning - broke out in hives after having their fish and chips : ' (
Wow absolutely the one of the top worst food I have ever had . My hashbrowns tasted like chemicals ! Horrible environment . I will never eat here again .
Wish I could give no stars . Waited over 10 minutes the staff could not figure out who was going to take our order . We left made a comment to the hostess but went on deaf ears .
This guys charge you $ 200 to file your taxes what an absurd , also learn how to speak proper English if your trying to work in a professional line of business .
After going here numerous times , we ' ve concluded that the food is boring and lacking flavor . Go for the queso and margaritas . Skip the dinner .
Only lines moving were the self checkout lines . They require giant eagle card to get started . Cashiers had no help bagging . Excruciating .
I came with my family because of the buy 1 get 1 coupon but it was a rip off . They capped the coupon at $ 10 and there was only one sandwich at that value .
Roses not labeled accurately at all . Half dead too . Got home and realized I made a poor choice after googling .
What a mess . Can ' t walk the aisles or find anything . Spent $ 7 and left to the 99 cents store across the street .
I used to like Lola until I learned the owner is a sexist pig . I will never visit again !
Super slow drive through . Like five to seven minutes a car slow .
This place sucks . Almost every machine is broken and the idiot employees are walking around eating bananas . No management and daft employees . Will not be back !
basically hated the fact that we were there . didn ' t want to help us eat delicious food m , so we left after paying $ 12 for soda and a bud light .
In Summary : mediocre food , awful service , margaritas bad enough that our table sent them back , and a cashier that charged my card twice .
Forty minute wait . Cold food for my wife . Over cooked eggs for my eggs Benedict . Lots of choices in MMR now . Over Easy I ' m so over you .
The only thing good about this place depends on whose spinning that night . Staff was rude . Bathrooms are disgusting and old Most likely will wait to see the djs somewhere else before coming back .
My chicken burrito turned out great but my boyfriends steak burrito had two strands of long blonde hair in it . Just gross . Probably will go to a different location from now on now .
Save your time and money and fry your fish at home or make a sandwich . This is not the solution to you hunger pains I promise you .
Stay far away from this ' rescue ' . Bad review they remove it - disagree with them they get very vindictive .
Congratulations on promoting racial divide with your horribly divisive commercial ! The last place I would consider obtaining a degree from when you have to stoop to those subliminal tactics !
Waited 20 minutes for a single sub while crew looked helpless . I ' ve never been here before , but can ' t go back during lunch if this is typical .
Got a hair in the noodle and the server asked me : do you want to take the hair out or change to a new one ? Me : please cancel my order .
Worst customer service not friendly at all they don ' t answer the phone when you call Hope someone from company try to call them as a customer and find out what kind of people they hire
Not to good was Disappointed seafood is not fresh which I understand stand cuzz we ' re not near water . So basically just frozen seafood .
So as I sit here as we speak , their pot pie bites are frozen I find because cold inside , and a cool bug was floating in my beer . Very disappointed . . .
Sadly , I stopped by the other day and the restaurant was closed and a new pho restaurant appears to be opening . Too bad , we enjoyed this place .
This is an embarrassment to Chicago . . . . Our food taste nothing like this ! ! Fries were burnt , bread was stale I will never eat here again .
Place is just bad . So many people told me this place has the best chicken . It really was just awful .
Service was awful . The burger arrived 10 minutes before the fries . Shake never made it with the meal . Not a good experience .
The ladies in this store are all stuck up and rude ! I detest going in here . I will make the trek down to fashion show or order online .
Food was ok . Nothing to rave about . Price was on the high side . Don ' t plan on coming back .
Ate few days back . Whole restaurant was empty . Food was just ok . Service not so good . Will not go back .
The worst Thai I have had . Ordered medium Massaman curry and it lacked flavor . It was not spicy and tasted nothing like coconut . The potatoes were also still crunchy .
Poor service . Owner could care less and maybe that ' s why he ' s struggling financially .
0 star for this store . very dirty no public restroom . . and of course they have the worst customer services
The Rumbi Island Grill restaurant is no longer open at the 4280 E Indian School Rd location .
SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW This is the SLOWEST bank ! ! ! There is no excuse for an empty teller window when you have a line of people to the door .
Couldn ' t get a keg order right to save their lives . Never even placed the order despite me calling every Friday to ask if they received it .
Stopped by for a quick meal . Ordered the numder 1 meal add bacon . Made it home , took a bite of the burger and to my surprise no burger
Horrible customer service they ' re too busy and uninterested in solving issues for their customers . Hours and hours of wasted time trying to talk to anyone who can correct a billing error THEY created .
Unorganized and chaotic place . Mixed up different tables orders ; didn ' t service food in order it was placed and took 30 - 40 for a sandwich . Good cappuccinos
never enough cashiers , so stopping in ' real quick ' is basically impossible . i have to wait in line for at least 10 minutes every time i make the mistake of coming here
Good food . A lot of worthless taps . No local brews at all . Shame .
Horrible customer service . When orders are wrong , the customer should come first . I appreciated the original location but my experience has turned me off from both , now !
Slow poor service . made us wait 20 mins for drinks . And wait for food was like 45 mins . Stay away .
Food was not too bad but that waitress was so rude . We don ' t want to visiting anymore and find another nice restaurant .
Pizza cold all toppings fell of and salad came with a breadstick bowl . Not a good take out place
Waited an hour , watched others get seated , fed , and checked out , then told it would be another 8 minutes .
yeah . skip it . microwave breakfast food . gross . maybe the other stuff in the freezers is ok but given their lack of storefront and business , i ' m not willing to try .
Worst taxis services ever , they lied about the time of arrival and they were super rude on the phone , they said 15 ' 20 ' and I took more like an hour .
四川担々麺がピリ辛で美味しかっただけど、友達はあごの手術を受けたせいで口を大きく開けないんだ。そのため「锅贴」っていうそもそも焼き餃子みたいなやり方で、型は細長いものを注文した。けど、持ってきたものは水餃子をちょっとだけ焼いたもので、美味しくないし、友達が食べる時もめちゃくちゃ不便。店員に聞いたら : あなた以前食べたもんはどうでもいい、うちはこういうやり方だ！ってその態度にびっくりしました。この店を避けた方がいい。 朋友下颌骨受伤不能张大口吃东西，所以选了长形的锅贴方便食用，结果端上来一盘水饺煮好后微煎一下的东西，做不出锅贴就别拿煎饺糊弄吧，服务员理直气壮说：我们这儿的锅贴就是这样！态度差到令人咂舌。
I ' ve given this location a try twice . They screwed up both orders , once giving us a happy meal with an empty box where the nuggets should have been . Skip it .
Do not recommend . A guy by the name of Angel is telling me I need to spend $ 350 to see what design he came up with for my front landscaping . Very poor customer service .
Sometimes they get it right and most the times they don ' t . But it ' s burger king fast food it taste good and cheap .
Food was ok , my fajitas were over cooked . Service is lousy . Appetizers came out after the entree . Our server was indifferent . Overall it ' s just another tourist trap .
One of the worst places I ' ve have ever eaten . Chicken was like rubber and the dumplings were cold . Anyone who likes this place has never had good food
This place was much better years ago . Dirty , , in disrepair , and most rooms and common areas hasve the faint stench of stale beer and cigarettes . You ' d be better served elsewhere .
Buyer be ware . They sold be a stained dress . The salesperson was pushy and misrepresented or didn ' t know if the dress could be altered .
2162242312 couldn ' t deliver a pizza or leave a voice mail guess they just lost a regular customer because they can ' t deliver
Ordered the Nam Prik Chicken and got shrimp instead . After a long wait for the unresponsive staff to get my order right the food was terrible .
Nothing like I remember it being . The Crust was tough and not much flavor . Cheese was okay the pepperoni was average at the best . Way to expensive for this will not be trying again .
Great service in the past but cost cutting is really affecting the service . Buttons broken too often and the deadlines missed have made me look for a different place .
The car was clean and the agents friendly . My complaint is that I reserved online a standard car 2 days prior to the need and there was not one on the lot when I arrived .
Super disappointed . Pizza was bland and tasteless . Beer labeled as shock top was not that . Worker was rude and pretty short with customers .
TWO WORDS - inconsistent & indifferent
Terrible service all around . Been put on hold multiple times for a simple question . They don ' t care about their customers one bit .
Came in here with 8 people on a night when there were 2 other people in here . The bartender was super bossy . Not into it . No need to come back here .
11 $ for a soggy burrito , and pretty sure the fish was bad . I ' d rather go to chipotle or Filiberto ' s .
I ordered pad thai and my son ordered curry . Both of us were not impressed . The food is a little bit blend . I am not going to go back . The service was good .
The owners other rstur . just closed by health dept , mold all over the food . be careful this place may be the last place you ever eat . . food is quite bland .
If I ' m ordering a blizzard I ' d expect it to be blended not only was half a banana intact in my daughters cup the ice cream looked completely white no add - ons in sight
Okish food . Avoidable . Have tasted better Indian food in the valley . Paneer kati wrap I liked . Else the mango Lassi vada pav pav bhaji were very ok
They don ' t clean the beer lines and the prices are outrageous . Other than that . . . The staff is very nice and so is the view . Not a good place to drink beer
Why the * * * * does DQ exist ? It ' s expensive as * * * * and taste like * * * * , I prefer McDonald ' s ice cream
They seem to conveniently be out of compact cars every time I ' ve been here . They suck .
Drive through person wasn ' t really paying attention and ended up messing up forgetting my order of egg rolls . Unfortunately I didn ' t notice until I drove all the way home .
Too expensive for quick food court food . You get very little meat even with the high price . They sucker you by charging almost $ 5 . 00 for a bottle water .
Negative 3 stars ! Ordered sweet and sour pork , tasted like crap , rice and egg were no good . Everything tastes old . Hope I don ' t get sick !
Driver was nice and the drive was good but the bus . The bus was stinky and dirty . Not a great exp . renting a car is way better
Food has gone from fair to bad , really bad . Got an omelette that had burnt bacon on top of it , plus very little edible bacon inside . Pathetic .
Very inconsiderate of my time . Poor communication . It took 4 days for them to realize the dealer trade to get my vehicle wasn ' t going to happen . Won ' t go back .
My wife went there and the large person was very discourteous . This used to be our first choice for service but they forgot who pays their company .
I had a craving for a noodle soup and I was at MEC on a rainy evening . The chicken udon did the trick but I would not go out of my way to eat here .
Dont know how this place got 4 stars what a dive nobody there sat 5 min nobody came left won ' t go again
Don ' t just don ' t take this cab service . Trust me . It was horrible . Their driver was rude and horrible at driving . Nearly got into an accident . I ' d rather walk
Hey ! You a plus sized woman looking for a velour cougar print shirt or shirts with horizontal stripes ? ! Go here ! ! !
Passable food , but overpriced by a LOT . Not going there again . : \
Like the ambience but their drinks aren ' t good , I mean the cocktails . Even a basic mojito isn ' t good . Just go their for the ambience in the summer .
Horrible customer service . Manager didn ' t even bother to help , slow service and really smoky that your eyes is gonna start bothering you . Never had a great experience here and not worth the money .
Terrible service and mediocre food . I will not step in there again . Waited approximately 30min to get service . At the end we left without even ordering .
Dirty dinning list will not go here again sad cuz there donuts were good . Mold violations and others that make you think wow you just don ' t care .
We went on country dancing night . Not enough chairs or tables and the bar tenders were slow . I actually liked the place and could see going back but they just need more seating .
The Price and The Food Quality not same . No a lot of food can choose . The Seafood very salting . No any fruit in the dinner time .
Yeah it ' s close to everything but the rooms aresuper dirty . I would never sleep in this hotel again .
Overated , food had little taste , service was bad , not worth the higher prices they charge
Slowest service while all the staff stands around with a like of people waiting . I ' ll go elsewhere . One teller in particular is rude every time .
This store is so unorganized . The people behind the counter have no people skills , and really don ' t know their job . Would highly recommend going somewhere else .
Disapointing , overpriced , and left hungry . There are many better sushi restaurants in the city . I had such high expectations for this place .
Sitting here ratting a late breakfast and the chef is eating as he is preparing the food , the food has declined tremendous over the past few months
I wish I could tell you more about the store but I was immediately disgusted by the smell of incense . Might work for some people , if your sensitive like I am , I would stay away .
Bought the Bee Grateful and there ' s wayyyyy too much ginger in it . Overpriced for juices but hey it ' s the Cosmo !
Yellow cab now known as Ztrip is the worse thing on earth call uber instead ! ! if you want to get where you are going on time all of ztrip sucks ass !
Great food , stuff very friendly but the floor tiles thru out the place very disgusting that should be cleaned once every 6 months total turned off how come the healthy department don ' t see that ?
Customer service is a joke . I cancelled my paper . They stopped delivery but they are still charging my credit card . I shouldn ' t have to call 4 times to get a refund .
The food is not that authentic . The sauces are too thick , salty and not subtle . They use the wrong white rice , short grain instead of Jasmine .
We tried to eat at this location Thursday May 17th . We walked out after 1 1 / 2 hours waiting for our food . Someone needs to come in and get this resturant back into sgape .
Unimpressive flavor for appetizers and sandwich . Expensive beers Nice responsive staff and attractive building with lots of tvs
A BBQ joint with no BBQ . Apparently this is a common occurrence with them . Shame I drove out of my way to get here .
Way too expensive for mediocre Mexcian food .
Don ' t order the pulled pork sandwich . It made me sick all night long and couldn ' t leave the hotel room all the next day , ruined my trip to Vegas
What can I say we were in Vegas for 7 and staying at harrahs we would have been better off at the bar or gambling .
First time here . Horrible service . Waited over 15 mins to get anyone to stop at our table . Had to go to hostess to complain . Won ' t be coming back .
It ' s in a Wal - Mart parking lot . Really that ' s enough said . I ' m also giving myself for expecting more .
I enjoy a good frozen yogurt , but honestly don ' t know how pinkberry stays in business with its hands off approach and pricing . . . Where is a Yogurtland when you need one
Men who work there called me sweetheart and honey , and they don ' t make their own crust . Not a pleasant experience
Not coming back here . They changed their menu . I paid more than 20 $ but they dont even have a simple fried chicken in fact they barely have any meat . .
This location has 7 tables that were dirty , took 15 minutes to be seated and 30 minutes to get our food ! Great food but that ' s it .
Don ' t come here at all bad customer service waiting almost 40min for a chicken burrito
I got steak and egg and my husband got the salmon and clam bowel . All of our food were extremely salty . Almost not eatable ! We won ' t be back
Only gave one star because I had to . Sopa . are not native Indian frybread . Totally different flavors . Some people will just eat anything .
12 dollar hockey puck with skate blade bacon . Destroyed my insides later that night . Ate at 4 places while there . 2 were terrible . 2 were good ( Grumans and Uno Pizza ) .
The menu was pricey . Pretty good service . Below average food . Gravy sucked . Beef dip & chicken club both not very tasty . Probably will not come here again .
Service is indifferent . Total tourist trap . The food is alright but overpriced for what you get . But then it ' s Vegas . Enough said !
Bunch of grumpy old women working there . Poor customer service and food is not so great
Under new management . The menu , service , price and vibe are not good . Three bad experiences over past month .
$ 45 . 95 for 2people BBQ . Las Vegas Not worth the money . Better go buffet in Vegas next time
The food and drinks were overpriced and bland . This restaurant was our favorite Mexican restaurant when it was on East Blvd . It must have changed hands . We won ' t be going back .
Really unimpressed after hearing nothing but good things . Burger patty was dry and totally overwhelmed by all of the bread in the bun . Won ' t be back .
I went to Los Taquitos . The girl at the counter pocketed the cash and messed my order up . Not a great experience .
Piece of shit place . They called the cops on me since they only accept cash and not credit card . Go to pho Kim long around the corner , better atmosphere and better service .
Terrible not closing for another 40 minutes when I asked and they couldn ' t make more chow mein . How do you not have something when that ' s one of your main items
Decent food , decent staff , but its a stark corporate echo chamber . Not a nice place to be .
Ordered the poke bowl . It was pretty plain , bland and boring . Salmon serving size was laughable . For $ 15 you get way better poke around the corner at Poke Eats
Very friendly staff but I found the food incredibly salty . To the point where I couldn ' t finish my meal . If salt doesn ' t bother you then this is a 3 - star joint .
Dont call the 1800 number . Because when the Local person calls you , the prices automatically go up
For a " High End " joint , this place leaves you in want . Move on .
Interesting place and service was good , but their sandwiches are average at best . Same with the bread .
Had it once a while back , didn ' t like it . Wouldn ' t recommend to try it or for myself go there again . Definitely tasted better shawarmas
They ' re so slow . Worst one ever ! They should do the 60 second challenge like other locations because they lack speed and service ! ! !
Sucks bad selection and not fast on getting the food out . Server took more than 20 mins to get a refill on your drink and cleanliness wasn ' t great on the tables .
I suspect the ratings are very dependent on what time of day you are there , eg , lunchtime or 4am . I was there at lunchtime and it was rough
This place absolutely sucks . Employees act like their busy when nobody ' s around and don ' t even bother asking you for help . I ' d rather go to the one in Chandler !
This place is awful and is filled with awful people . Splurge an extra $ 5 and spend your money somewhere that is run by actual decent human beings .
Wings were extremely saucy . To the point that it ruined the taste of the wings . And the dry wings were extremely salty . Service and atmosphere was good .
Poor service . Always slow . Even ordering with online doesn ' t help . Went to Wendy ' s down the street instead .
Still no won ' t go back to your place ever . Your good is horrible and service isn ' t any better .
Aggravating . Bad service . Been there twice and the male wait staff are incredibly arrogant and lazy . Wouldn ' t even split up the check when asked . Will not go back .
Sin city burger was extremely over cooked and had a weird sauce . Smash fries were the only good part of the meal .
Terrible otel . Room was dirty , curtains torn , safe did not work . Housekeeping did nothing but make up the bed . Would not recommend this hotel to anyone !
This place was terrible . Seriously who puts processed yellow cheese slices on pastrami sandwiches .
An amazingly terrible breakfast buffet , are you even trying ? Explains why the restaurant is empty .
Service is slow and sucks . . wait is to dam long Made a group reservation and the didn ' t have it
Elegant place with mediocre food . Lots of bling while the servers treat you as if they really wished you ' d gone somewhere else for dinner .
What a shit hole . Wifi I can ' t log in to . Crappy elevators . The walkway to the palms is live the green mile . Should be burned to the ground .
This store must have the angriest employees I ' ve ever witnessed . So miserable and unfriendly . If looks could kill , well you get the point . . . .
They slow you kart down every 45 seconds and you can ' t compete . . . takes the fun out of racing . Pretty lame .
Not the greatest , room had a horrible stench and between the train and the jet fighters - thank goodness they give you ear plugs -
Staff is rude . They need to be reminded that patients are there because of an illness or injury , a little compassion goes a long way .
Bought 4 items , 3 rang up wrong . Had to walk sales clerk over to racks . Macys I expect more from you .
DO NOT USE THE DRIVE THRU HERE , you ' ll wait long enough to make you wish you would have abandoned your order 10 minutes ago .
A pretty good pizza but was told that it should be delivered in about 45 minutes instead of the 2 hours that it took .
I would never recommend this place . I was turned away before I even set foot in the office , couldn ' t schedule an appointment because of the parental Choice I ' ve made for my son .
Very weak in terms of service and food at a too high price . Bizarre attempt at including american and asian Pass it up
Tried to have dimmer here . 5 : 12 and still closed . No note or sign for explanation . Unfortunate because I would have enjoyed trying it !
Cleveland needs to take care of the little things . Make it nicer in the terminals . Add more outlets and general esthetics .
Service was slow as molasses and there was nothing even happening . Just paperwork for an oil change took 15 minutes . So much for a shortcut . Waisting away again at pep boys .
This company has left post - it fliers on door everyday this week ! I was considering this company but now I ' m annoyed .
Gel Nail polish and acrylic came off very next day on a service over $ 100 . Not going back .
Expensive hotel breakfast buffet . Not worth the cost ( unless you ' re staying there and it ' s included in your room costs )
Place was dirty . Beer selection was not exciting . Food was meh , and overpriced . Not somewhere I ' d take my family , or a date to .
Wait , wait , wait . No thanks , we ' ll just find someplace that knows how to turn over tables for breakfast .
This was my first and last time eating at Otro Cafe . The food was Bland and not very good . It was quite expensive but had a nice atmosphere .
Food is okay . Service is questionable . Needs improvement . Worst coffee I have ever tasted .
just wasn ' t impressed . i had heard good things about harlows but the food was not noteworthy , the prices werent ' great for what you got and the waitress was a little rude
They refused me service due to my SERVICE dog ! Cab pulled up said in broken English no I no take dog and left Do not use this company !
- small and standard pub in roncy with a shuffleboard - nothing special , but nothing terrible about it . - didn ' t try the food .
Brisket was dry and rubbery . The sides were not fresh . I recommend avoiding this chain restaurant for real , local BBQ . The positive is that the location is convenient being right on Blue Diamond .
Worst costumer service ever . Won ' t give you a cup of water . Food is less than mediocre . I really wish I ' d read the reviews before coming in here .
Very bad customer service . Want $ 300 cash deposit . . haha . . nothing in room amounts to it . Very disappointed . Will not go back ever .
Wouldn ' t recommend this place at all . Chicken was grey and had funny taste . Pita Kitchen off McDowell and 99th Ave is by far the best ! ! !
The BBQ chicken wrap was only so - so . Tasted like chicken dunked in cheap sauce . Fries were good . The stuff they called " cola " was terrible .
Being a fan of South Indian vegetarian cuisine went to dine there but it was a total disappointment .
Mediocre meat quality , overpriced , service was slow and salad bar was blah . Overall don ' t recommend and won ' t return
This place used to be good . Looks like change of management . Moreover they charge a hidden credit card transaction fee .
The service was quick . I went here early morning for breakfast of coffee and a muffin . Both were fresh and inexpensive .
We ordered beef and chicken burger with curly fries . Burgers were tasteless and completely burned , and the fries was dry like stone .
They are extremely expensive and do an average job . They knocked a picture off the wall and never told me . They took my trash after I asked that it be left in the garage .
The general manager can send me a message on here if they plan on reaching out . My review is self explanatory and I do not plan to get into further arguments with this establishment .
Food was not spectacular , service was good but over priced for under whelming food . Won ' t return .
Food was fine but possibly the worst service I ' ve ever had . Not servers fault , she was alone in an almost full restaurant .
Elizabeth Montgomery is a deceitful and extremely unethical realtor . She will only show and sell you property that earns her the highest commission ! Beware her advice may cost you thousands of dollars !
Not good at all ! ! ! ! It ' s beautiful , but don ' t be fooled by that . Nothing was that good there , it was edible , but nothing great .
Well all I can say is Beware . I believe the food I received was not prepared on property . It needs many improvements . Window and floors needed cleaning
Way way way over prices drinks . Like ridiculously over priced . And the tables all wobble . .
Go to a different Starbucks , horrible wait time . They are completely understaffed . There was a line all the way to the entrance . Will not be coming back
HORRIBLE . very unprofessional and won ' t answer calls once they get you to sign that contract .
The worst lunch experience in Vegas . Food is so normal Hot tea charge money Not cheap
I was extremely disappointed with the quality of service from the check - in desk . Waited in line for over an hour to be told I could not check in yet .
Hey Albertsons on Rampart in Summerlin and same at Pavilion Center in Summerlin , not one piece of corned beef at either store on St . PATRICK ' S DAY . I ' m done .
Crap ! No really the worst pizza ever will never order it again . Threw it out after one bite ! ! !
Slow ass drive through seriously l , poor service , poor management have the car park in the parking to get their food the place is empty and it takes 10 min just to get service
1 star for locating the car rental facility in effing Indiana . If you ' re returning a rental car , be sure to build in an extra 3 hours to get shuttled to the airport . Sweet Jebus
Feel bad for this place only have 2 people working and it ' s 5 o clock feel like there should be more people so this wait wasn ' t so ridiculous : (
Took a taxi here from hotel bc of reviews - Walked in and walked out - not sure how they got these reviews . Strong smell and broken floor - below standards for a beauty care facility .
Not very pleased with the manager . Not friendly at all . Drinks on the other hand are good but people also make the atmosphere .
Never eat here . They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up .
The food was cold and portions were small for the price . I also ordered a tres leches dessert and it tasted like it had been in the refrigerator for weeks .
Pretty weak lunch . . . calamari salad was tough , cheap Chinese crap , crab dip was edible
Unbelievably slow , rude , and unprofessional service . Tasty hot chocolate . Somewhat expensive . Good location .
Truly sad to hear another customer berated and called a liar . Will not shop here in the future .
HORRIBLE I am literally sitting in the restaurant writing this review . Who puts a dollop of mayo on sushi ? Very friendly people , terrible food .
This place is a french want to be restaurant . Not really premium and authentic french food , Very americanized and expensive .
This was my son ' s first and last time here . I showed the lady a picture and she did the opposite .
I miss Mike P . The morning show hasn ' t been the same without him . . . so I don ' t listen .
Rude owner and staff . More like a Teriyaki joint . Unsanitary food storing methods . Do not come here . . . . . .
This location has very slow service and consistently runs out of several products . Don ' t waste your time going there .
This location has idiots working there , you to spell and point put every little thing . I will never go back to any Freddy ' s location !
Probably a good place for drinks but the food is not the best . Guacamole is excellent .
Not the worst but still depressingly bad pizza . They are open late for what that ' s worth
Very rude waitress in the Strongsville location . don ' t think I will ever go back due to her behavior .
Not a fan of places that won ' t let you bring your own brand new parts / items . I understand they have things to sell but they have labor they can bill for also .
Over priced and completely underwhelming . Everything on the Sofa mixed grill platter tasted like nothing . The hummus and falafel had no taste either . None . Great service , but for what ?
Clueless staff . Ordered to go . Had to ask for my card back . Then had to go back because there was no dressing for the salad and no fork . Frist and last time .
Ok place . They had some selection of music . I bought a warped record that was on the shelf but was $ 5 so I cant complain . Will not be going there again .
Awful experience in this place they may also have some racial bias ! Take your money elsewhere !
Food was ok . . . service was very slow . . waited over 30 minutes but was reasonably priced so i guess you get what you pay for .
Worst service dept I ' ve ever seen . The service manager Jeff Schall is not concerned with his customers whatsoever . He refuses to get out of his chair to even talk with you .
Below Average Brazilian Steakhouse . Meats and Salad bar were average . They were slow bringing the meats around . Over priced for the quality
Tried to park there , but apparently they close their lot at 4 : 30 for some unknown reason . . .
We came here in search of prime rib . They were out except for one serving . We had 12 people . It was not good . Sadly the best part of everyones meal was the free salad .
The only reason you go there is because the buffet line is too long and this place is right next door . Food is astonishingly expensive for subpar quality .
T he bartender is associated with md13 . I think his name is Andyl . Worst service e ever
The food was mediocre at best and the noise and loud music was deafening !
This hotel is so run down . It is cheap and dirty . They have roaches . I didnt pay but a friend did and I feel so bad . She said she was ripped off .
Very disappointing in this location . Definitely does not live up to the Denny ' s I know
Hamburger was worse than McDonald ' s hamburger . Sloppy and soggy and messy . The fries were average . Nothing impressed me and I will not be giving it a second chance .
Dicks Sporting goods alright . I ordered a Jersey online and I picked it up . The customer service is alright , but they could be nicer .
Filthy keyboards at the computer terminals ; bathrooms reek of urine .
Fucking incompetent ! ! ! Nothing but liars and malcontents that obviously are used to doing absolutely nothing for their pay checks .
pricey considering the quality of the sashimi . spicy salmon sushi wasn ' t spicy at all . no toilet paper . reused the same glass for pop .
Horrible customer service . When there are so many wonderful places to stay in vegas with excellent customer service , why stay at Trump ?
Food is pretty good but there is some guy in the bathroom asking for tips to wash your hands . Ridiculous
I would love to give this place negative stars if I could . Piss poor service , the kind that makes you want to leave right away , and mediocre food .
This place is no longer in business . It has been closed for at least 4 months . At first sign said closed for remodel been has since been taken down .
Came here for a VIP wash . Except they missed a few spots . . . . The only upside was that there was no wait time , and the prices are decent .
Customers beware their offline handling of bookings . You will either be asked to wait an hour plus or asked to come back another time . Not worth the aggravation .
Bland is the best description of food taste I can post and remain civil . Long service wait for food . Better choices are available in a restaurant - rich area of west - Glendale / Peoria .
I have been coming here since it opened . We ordered take out tonight and the quality was terrible . We were all very disappointed
If you love lawyers that never return calls , do horrible jobs , and ruin cases for their clients . Then go to this office , otherwise stay clear . Worst lawyer I ' ve ever been to .
Food was not that great . It had way too much cinnamon . Would not recommend this place . Definitely needs help !
I have gone in 3 times now to buy 2 cases of water and they have been out every time . Never have any carts at the lumber checkout .
I hate them too - I am trying ONLY to fly Virgin America ! Those people kick ass .
Takes way too long to receive your food and when I got my tacos the shells were soggy . Will not be returning to this filibertos .
Slow , incompetent service delivered with a snarl . My family will not back .
the staff were a bit slow even though it wasnt busy . the food wasnt so bad but could have been better . i always try different places but wasnt very happy with sano sushi .
no one is ever up front to greet , location is not ideal and I ' ve found other doctors that reach out more and are more prominent in the area for same price .
Did not like the food , pancakes not cooked through , counter service for breakfast . This place was horrible ! Won ' t be back
Very dishonest people and terrible workmanship would never take my vehicle here !
What a disappointment . Food is way overpriced for its mediocre quality . For the same price , you can do yourself a favor a visit the real little Italy in Cleveland !
Called them at around 1 pm and driver didn ' t come until close to 9 ( I was told no later than 8 ) . Caused me a lot of wasted time . Staff were rude and unpleasant
Try cleaning your play area once in a while . It was so disgusting and both my kids got colds after going there .
This place is closed but still shows up on Google Maps . Tried going there May 2013 and the store was vacant . There is no answer if you call the phone number .
Not totally cooked ! Worst service ever ! Bad surrounding ! Never try it again . This is not Chinese dumplings at all !
College cafeteria quality pasta and salads with self service and a surprisingly high price point . Pass
CLOSED - Sadly Cafe Krishna ' s service went down hill in the last few months and they have now closed . Hopefully the replacement will be as good as Krishna was before the change in staff .
our floor maid checked in our suite while we were still in the living / kitchen area , and asked if she could just punch in . then she didnt come back to clean our suite .
Been to 3 Skechers stores NO 14 ' s . So if your looking for larger sizes shop Amazon . It ' s so frustrating to spend an hour walking up and down this store for no shoes .
One Oreo cookie donut counts as two . Who thought about this rip off . I usually stop by after picking up the kids at school . Not anymore .
Wasn ' t a fan of this place . Small portions , lack of flavour , hot sauce annoying to get out of bottle and awkward service . Place didn ' t have a Brazilian vibe to it .
How about ZERO stars ? Maybe 1 star for free non - valet parking .
Sitting in the drive thru now for 30 minutes for an Ala Carte broccoli beef this place may have just messed with my job so much for lunch hours
Service was poor from the moment we entered , to say the least . I was so excited to try this place but nothing I had was memorable . I would not come back !
Don ' t ask Carol to help with anything but complain to you in front of your face . Awful customer service .
Management treats their employees terrible ! Service is bad because manage net doesn ' t properly train employees . Then they cuss and degrade the employees in front of customers ! Worst place ever .
What a joke standing in line in this BofA long line 2 tellers wking . This bank sucks !
Every time we have chosen to go to this restaurant they are closed ! Do not order on any possible holiday or Sunday !
New menu is lacking and way overpriced . Burger was not cooked to order then over cooked on take two . Rest of the meal was underwhelming . Waitress was rude .
Terrible service , unreliable , try anyone else before you call these people . Rude on the phone , showed up an hour late ! ! ! ! !
Really rude cashier . Walked in and got stared at , employees only talking to each other and ignoring us - the customers .
In my honest opinion the fish did not taste fresh at all . The tuna was super stringy . Side note I ' m also pretty picky with my sushi .
Don ' t ever come here if you want to be quick about any thing or have your order taken correctly or even taken at all ! ! ! Unbelievable
Way too loud they arent sure if theyre a disco or restrnt . Food was not worthwhile at all . The famous mac n cheese greasy n nasty
The food was delicious but just waaay too over priced ! . $ 115 for Peking duck that ' s insanity !
Tea is never served hot . Lukewarm at best . Pastries & other foods that are served are dried out . Some of the staff is courteous & polite others certainly are neither .
We are not happy with waitress since we are waiting for order our foods and waste my time . I hope this resturant need improve and on time for order foods
The only reason the did get that star was because the sandwich taste good . To much breath not enough meat , and over priced sandwiches . Go to Lennys it ' s better in every way .
Service at this location really puts me off . I ' ll try the one at exchange tower after two bad experiences at this location .
Started with some salty crab puffs and some excellent chicken egg rolls . Nothing to rave about . Wouldn ' t go back .
Cash only , but you ' ll have plenty of time to look for loose change under your seats while waiting in the drive - through for over 10 minutes .
They are the worst at leaving expired items on the shelves . Of course I always look at meat , produce and diary but not always packaged items . Make sure you read the labels before purchasing !
Salesman wasted my time . . What an ass . He was really nice though . Cars are way overpriced , service guys seem nice . $ 50 . For an oil change ?
Was a weekly regular . They used to have awesome wings ( dry rub ) , but then they screwed them up and raised the prices . Stopped going as I couldn ' t stand it .
The food was expensive , doesn ' t have taste , cold vegetables , dry burger . . . I don ' t recommend !
Clean office friendly staff . This place is always a long wait time ! ! And just cold as can be ! Bring a jacket it ' s like a meat locker in here !
It should not take 30 mins to make a smoothie that doesn ' t even taste good . Plus the boba came out hard . Horrible .
Terrible service . . . broken promises . . . . . poor customer relations , never on time with deadlines , excuses after excuses , etc .
This location is now closed ! Went down with a package yesterday afternoon and the place is empty .
The worse Mediterranean food Ive had in my life . Bad service and the restaurants freezing cold ! Food was dried out and worthless .
Only two stars because the soup was good . Service is slow , waitress ' s are unprofessional and ghetto . Olive Garden is not what it used to be
This place is GROSS . The food is gross , along with the decor & especially the carpet . I wouldn ' t feed my dog scraps from this place .
They would only take 36 off for the $ 40 yelp deal ? Floor was sticky and food was standard . I would not go back nothing special .
Too expensive . Couldn ' t understand the agent . Don ' t get ripped off on insurance . They tried to give me a mustang convertible when I wanted an economy
Some of the rudest employees I have ever encountered . Ended up leaving without even dropping off the clothes I stopped by to sell , I was so turned off by their lack of customer service .
Ehh . . definitely was not impressed with any dishes I ordered today ! Maybe . . just maybe the porridge . But even so , the food was ehhh .
Worst place I even did business with . Lousy service . The installer were loud and lazy . I will never ever use them again . And I hate the singing bitch in the tv commercials ! ! !
Nice atmosphere , service was lacking . I had the 8 layer salad . . Tasty and the red sangria smooth and the myan milkshake was their saving grace .
I didn ' t really like the seafood tofu soup that I ordered . It was over priced and didn ' t taste any good . Maybe the next time I go it will be better .
Just waited 40 minutes for a hot dog no different than any other in town ( in fact , Short Leash and Portillo ' s much better ) . Will not be back .
Not good at all , very little variety . Salad was wilted , nothing for my kids to eat . Would not recommend
steak wasn ' t terrible , but at about $ 150 + per person with an automatic gratuity , the service was terrible . Drink refills were slow . We felt ignored while there .
This is the slowest serving panda express I have ever been to . Four different visits here and every time it took more then 20 minutes to get through the drive thru . VERY slow .
I ' ve now been here 3 times and will not be returning food is not that great and service Is mediocre all three times very disappointing .
Their sandwich scared me . It was way too overwhelming . i ' m still contemplating if I ever want to go back . . . .
One of your drivers is a dickhead that ' s on duty right now and drives recklessly on the freeway that is all
sprouts seems to be involved in price gouging , every thing in here is overpriced
Such a horrible job with the car wash . Inside and out completely dirty . I could have saved my money . Came home and re - did myself . Never going back
The pizza tastes like something you microwave . The combo comes with a small cup . If other pizza places are open id avoid this one .
Pretty much what I ' ve come to expect from any Tim Horton ' s . Mediocre service , not friendly , not particularly clean . They somehow managed to get all 4 combos wrong . Sad .
The food was ok , but you should try a different chinese restaurant . The last time I went there was around 7pm , and the food was not fresh at all .
Long lines that move tremendously slow . Incompetent employees that always seem to damage or never deliver packages on time .
Wasn ' t like I remember growing up . I must say this place is way overpriced for a fast food joint .
Five Guys is a chain - franchise masquerading as a local burger joint . Their burgers are all right but overpriced and greasy
I just waited one hour for a veggie omelette that tasted like fish . The coffee was good .
Awful . New paint & art but still a Best Western at heart . Stay ANYWHERE else .
Food is fine but experience would ' ve been better if the staff stopped hitting on women long enough to get orders correct / completed promptly .
If your hungry , don ' t go , the service is slow and we had to walk out and go to el pollo loco . This review isn ' t even worth writing
Italian beef 3 star pizza 2 star cannoli a big fat 0 management lets pick it up . staff pretty much ill trained .
Absolutely useless service . Got locked out of room and made no effort to assist us what so ever . Not accommodating in any manner . Will not stay here again .
Very disappointing . Over hype under deliver . Bad parking lot layout . No seating . Not friendly . Selections very limited . Save time and eat at a nice Scottsdale restaurant .
Don ' t always feel welcome . Sometimes you feel like the owner , Yogi , is doing you a favor by letting you stay in his hotel with your money .
Went in Thursday for the chicken curry for dinner . . . I got a stomach flu now . Which means the chicken was under cooked . Thanks .
Only four cars in front of mine and thirty minutes later they still have not wiped my car down .
This place is the worst . Their customer service was shotty and was acting aggressive when asked to repeat an order . There call service sucks and is assholes fuck them they suck
Service was horrible . Wash rooms were un - kept . I was embarrassed to have hosted my girldfirend ' s bday here .
Flavour tastes superficial . I wasn ' t not impressed at all . I have been going to burrito boyz for years and this place is not there yet .
Ordered delivery and they forgot for two hours . Then proceeded to give me my food cold .
I have never waited less than 1 hour for a scheduled appointment . Does not matter how good the doctors are , I would not recommend to anyone .
Horrible horrible customer service . Wait time was 45 min plus and the Asian guy was way to pushy and rude when we politely declined their car insurance . Will not rent from here again .
Awful , awful service . Completely ignored while employees yucked it up in the kitchen and behind the counter . The meal was unremarkable and overpriced . Don ' t waste your time or money .
THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED . When it was in business it was hit - or - miss , more bad than good . Opened new location in Urbana .
Breakfast was great but dinner sucks a true disappointment I gave it a couple try ' s but it ' s a step above IHOP at best
NASTY kimchee rice . . Soggy . I asked for chicken and they gave me beef . Btw I am allergic . Never going there again
Servers unable to articulate specials . And a little bitchy , to say the least . Don ' t go here ever .

Cool place but holy smokes it ' s extremely slow service . Slow waiters and the kitchen is extremely slow .
Horrible service ! Waited 15 mins in line while they screwed up the order in front of us . Received a smoothie only 3 / 4 full . Requested another only to have it not made correctly !
Over - priced breakfast that isn ' t even that good . Otherwise , great location .
Her prices are outrageous . Didn ' t tell me about the increase in her prices until she was finished with my hair . I will never return or recommend her .
I ordered take out last Friday evening . Food was great . The hostess was rude . If it wasn ' t for the unwelcoming attitude , I would have given this a 5 star rating .
Worst experience ! Slow and you cannot get a refund ! Do not take this service and avoid at all cost !
Awesome . . 7 : 30 am on a weekday and someone decided to reset the fuel pump computers . Maybe have night shift do this ? 15 cars sitting here and stacking up .
This place has terrible service and the wait staff was rude . Save your money and don ' t waste your time .
Tee time got moved back by 40 minutes because they overbooked everything and then they decided to pair us with another 2 people . Ended up leaving .
Ordered pizza , mozzarella sticks and breadsticks . Delivery took over an hour and then they gave me meatballs instead of mozzarella sticks . Not similar at all .
Go to Pablo Will Victor Arod Montre Jayson Luigi or even Henry . Their whole team winning . end of story
Not that bad it was alright . Nothing too special from all the other hotels . Wish the rooms were a bit brighter in color but not like i stayed in the room alot anyways .
Assigned seating is childish . Service is horrible and some workers are disrespectful .
Worst service I ' ve had in a long time . Good happy hour prices on beer but I won ' t be back .
Awful customer service . . . . . . . ok other words necessary . . my advice don ' t waste your time nor money
Don ' t order the fried zucchini slices , you can ' t taste the zucchini at all , it is basically just eating panko .
This place has slow Service and the menu needs to be updated . I ' m only here for my sister birthday otherwise I wouldn ' t come here . If he menu was updated and had better service
WTF ? I went there for Asia Food Fest . And 3 dishes for 19 . 99 per person . Is this a wannabe buffet or a rip off place to go ? Maybe both ? ?
Came with a few folks before Tom Petty concert . Terrible service . Waitress disappeared . $ 11 . 00 for 2 little chicken nuggets on a loaf of bread that they called a Po Boy
Just ok . Food ok nothing new . Small dirty . This place needs something to set itself apart . Looks dingy tables sticky .
This was the most ridiculously longest wait we ' ve ever had at a McDonald ' s . More than 20 minutes to get through the drive thru only to ask them what our order was .
This place is gross . I had the white flatbread pizza for lunch . Two hours later I became extremely sick and was for the next two days . Never again .
Paid over 15 $ for two of the worst subs ever . No flavor , sloppy , just overall bad . Probably won ' t ever go back ! Waste of money .
- Waiting room is very small for a busy facility . - Wait times are very long ( even with an appointment ) - Doctor was very nice
The patty is decent , but tomato was the orange color of a candy Hallowe ' en pumpkin and the iced tea is not brewed but reconstituted - blech ! The fries are innocuous enough . Meh .
Just really overpriced for what it is . Decent mexican food , though small portions .
Nightmare ! - Worst restaurant ever . . Owner of the restaurant is disrespectful to customers . Try any other restaurant but DO NoT go the this restaurant . . You have been warned !
The guys that work here rude and sad treat people with lack of respect I feel sorry for our snow birds who come to our great city
Food was pretty good but the service is horrible . Even after the manager stopped by to resolve one issue the waitress is still MIA .
Crawling with roaches ! ! Saw four just getting a fountain drink ! ! Walked back out . Can ' t imagine getting food there .
Trainers are poorly educated on proper technique ' s . Also had my locker broken into by an employee and management did nothing about this issue .
Nail services felt very rushed , and not relaxing at all . Front desk said the owner would get back to me multiple times and never did . Not going back .
Bad service ! Was waiting for food for 50mins after we ordered . We also did not get a water refill after we asked twice and waited over 30mins , so we left . Will not return
WORST customer service , save yourself the headache and do business with FedEx or UPS . Dani was terrible !
Bathrooms filthy but the worst service ever . . . inattentive staff ignoring customers and instead talking to each other ! Dirty prep area . . . long wait ! I ' m leaving
Delivery took more than an hour on we weekdayand no apology whatsoever . The food was okay
Came here for dinner back in September 2013 . Everything we ordered came out very salty . ( beef salad , shrimp tom yum soup , chicken satay , pad thai ) .
Hire some highschool students or some people that communicate with the demoraphic area . This product requires customization . Drive thru - not a chance . Worst subway in the county .
Worst buffet I ' ve tried . The food didn ' t have flavor . Sushi was terrible . Will never eat here again . Don ' t know how this place stays open
Place is okay . Always feel like people here always think they are better than everyone else . Food is overpriced
Ate there for first time , . and had the runs all night , dont think i will go back , titos revenge ! !
I have to say , I am pretty disappointed in Yelp and their usually unnecessary Filtering . Scroll down to the 13 FILTERED reviews . . all of but 1 are 1 star .
Went to the show room set up an appointment . Nobody showed up . Called twice and was told we ' ll check to see where they are . Still waiting / no callback no show .
The place have very poor service and the food is not good anymore it not good at all
Restraunts and bar service exceptional . . casino floor and dealers rude with shotgun attitude . .
Good selection of sushi but I got diarrhea all night . I suspect from one of the maki rolls .
Went here on a Friday afternoon . Gates seemed locked . Closed down ? No times given on Yelp . Disappointing .
Environment seems decent for a college bar but bartender was rude and pretentious . Directly insulted a friend , his wife , and their child . Did not order , will not be back .
I had high expectations due to its publicity . To cut the story short , service was slack and food / drinks are far from gourmet . Wait staff was gracious when I complained though .
This place is bulshit i stopped to get some tea and they didn ' t serve it to me because i didn ' t get a hookah such a bad costumer service
Decent tasting food , but overall underwhelming portion sizes for the price . Great decor . Quick service .
The food seemed to lack favor honestly don ' t understand how they are so popular maybe I went on a bad day
Good ambiance , great tequila selection . Lack luster and mediocre food . We had two margaritas , three street tacos , and posole ; our dinner tab was $ 73 !
Just passing through and thought I would stop and check it out . Overpriced beer and bartenders very unknowledgeable . Not worth my stop .
Stay away from this location . The place is full of panhandlers and bums . They smell awful , are rude , bother people trying to eat and the managers won ' t do anything about it .
The room is pretty good for $ 55 but I would just see if there are other hotels around at the same price
It was okay but nothing special . The pita bread in my falafel wrap was dried out and tough . Kind of ruined it for me .
This location is now permanently closed . Would have been nice if they updated things online . Definitely had something sent here thinking it was open .
Most disgusting , bland chicken I ' ve ever had . Save your time & money and just eat at kfc instead
Okay Resturant , everything was marginal , chicken was dry , what they stand for is great but if you want good food this is not the place .
I showed up on Saturday at noon and no sign of anyone , I tried calling and no answer .
Way over - hyped and over - priced , save your money
Food was overpriced cafeteria food . Service was terrible . Fireball was over 5 $ a shot . STAY AWAY !
Not a great place at all . Applebee ' s quality food and way to much in price for that quality . Had to try it , not coming back .
Don ' t know why it took 20 min to get picked up from hospital and 30 bucks to go 2 miles in the middle of a weekday This town desperately needs uber
Pésimo servicio a parte única ponen salsa de tomate . En las órdenes para llevar y si fuera poco siempre se equivocan . En los pedido . Pésimo . Es poco . Cochinero de servicio
Horrible service , dining room is dirty and the soda machine is almost empty . Out of hundreds of options I think 3 are available . Won ' t go back .
Tried to get in , were told women were only allowed in one day a week ? Not sure what law prohibits that but Ok . Never coming back
The owner , " V " , does not pay employees on time , always in cash with no pay stubs . They have rats in the ceiling and overall dirty .
Always out of chicken . Staff in a hurry and throws your food around . They act like you are bothering them .
Ate at Outback for lunch with my family . Went back to hotel and vomited for the next 13 hours . Cause ? You decide .
Underwhelming . Sandwiches generally dry and not the best ingredients . Good if youve been drinking and nothing else is open .
Deplorable . If I could give 0 stars , I would . Slimy lettuce . Rubber ball chicken . Dirty tables and seats . snail like service .
Bad customer service . Don ' t go there . The guy in the front desk had a bad joke he not try to help nothing but push you to other place .
Dirtiest OG I have ever seen , sloppy service and nobody helped . Like there was no manager there
Didn ' t like thisd chickjen at all . I only gave it one star because this site wouldn ' t let me give a review unless I have at least one but it deserves no stars .
Food was decent . Service was nice , however waiting for our table to be called we were passed over numerous times . I won ' t be going back here again
Purchased a groupon coupon and was treated as a bother rather than being helpful ! I would not recommend this place ! ! ! ! !
This place is closed . ( Sorry for putting this in a review , but I cannot find the " report closed " button on yelp .
我是从湾区来的，吃的是tomi buffet，所以TI的buffet 对我来说简直是惨不忍睹！我指的是海鲜部分！一些老美的食物没有花时间去平常！ 值得一提的是clam chowder，吃出了异常多的沙，同时也偏咸！ 服务用收盘碗的速度快，环境非常的好！
High priced food , better going and get ur own burger ingredients and cook at home . I will not go back and get anything from here . . .
Average food , bad service . . . sweet potato tots are ok but didn ' t live up to all the hype .
The pizza is okay , not the best . Their wings are not good . They also took too long to deliver .
This hotel NO LONGER provides shuttle service between midnight and 4 am - so even if you have a hotel reservation or paid to park there for a week like I did , you will be stuck .
Ordered some tacos and waited for over 20 minutes coz they forgot my order ! They were not even aware until I asked what ' s taking so long . Cust svc
Chic . . . . to enjoy ambiance this is the place . . . . for food vs price . . . . . not . It is Las Vegas . Just enjoy the . . . .
horrible experience at this store . staff were obnoxious and showed no interest in helping me . i will NEVER go back to this store again .
Cool Name . Cool Decor . Other than that , not much to say . We went , options weren ' t really anything special . Taste was cheap and bland . Overpriced . Wont be going back .
Staff was nice food was terrible . I ' ll never eat here again .
Thrifty lives up to their expectation . Tons of hidden fees . Selling you on insurance you don ' t need . No surprise .
There are a thousand other places where you can get over cooked food with lazy service . Try one of them . You ' ll have a better experience .
Waited over 30 minutes for our food after ordering then had to leave for the concert without leaving . The staff didn ' t seem to care that we had to leave without eating .
Horrible time wait , food is dull and way to pricey for nothing . I don ' t recommend eating there
get sloshed and eat pretty bad food , but cheap so its a good place to end your night if you need to eat
service is slow , food is one star , place looks like a dump , pleaseeee buy some new chairs on the patio
My 3rd time here and the wait is RIDICULOUS ! I just need to speak with the PAC but I have been here almost an hour thus far which is ridiculous !
Drink sizes are extremely small and is mostly just ice . It ' s difficult to have a feeling of satisfaction at this place .
I ordered the baja shrimp tacos and they were COLD , what a joke ! I will never come back here !
They have completely FUBARD the happy hour menu . We won ' t be back until they bring the lamb , fruit - cheese plate , and other items back .
By far the worst and slowest service I ' ve ever seen . Bartenders rarely give free drinks even when you ' re playing , and the cocktail waitress took over 15 minutes just to bring change .
Scallops were brine tasting . Clothes smell like smoke from the kitchen . Lackluster food and service with a big tab .
This place did a horrible job on my nails I didn ' t like them at all I was really disappointed would not recommend I spent $ 30 and was not happy with my acrylics
For it being such an upscale restaurant they sure have really bad service . We waited over an hour for our food . And we didn ' t even order anything complicated . Would not return there
It ' s cheap and you get what you pay for . My iron stomach is a total mess . . . Never felt this bad after sushi in my life .
Worst possible place you could ever imagine living . You might as well take all of your money and throw it down the garbage disposal .
Horrible during Christmas time , not sure about other times of year . Very disorganized . Frustrating experience , doubt I ' ll be back next year .
90 minute wait and they lost my family ' s order . No excuse . No apologies . Wouldn ' t give our money back . No stars
Just tacos , not too satisfy with the amount of meat for the price . Come with a grill jalapeño and caramelized onions which were freaking cold . I think tacos el compita are much better and cheaper !
I ordered the " some like it hot " and it did have a bit of a kick to it , but lacked flavor . The waffle was thin and broke down half way into eating it .
I wish I could give negative stars . . . . only place in a city for cdl drivers . . . can ' t even get a number after being outside for over an hour
This place is a joke , they need to replace these unprofessional managers who don ' t know how to act like the adults they should be .
Don ' t do their surveys , very deceiving , it ' s an offer of 50 . 00 of shopping , not , you ' re offered junk .
Ordered chicken popcorn and french fries . Fries were clearly previously frozen . No good taste . Popcorn chicken was disgusting . Overly greasy with some more tastless mayonnaise grease on it . It went in the garbage .
This place has amazing sandwiches , but when I look at my transaction history to find that my 26 dollar order turned into 48 dollars it makes things bad . Watch your transactions with this place .
Avoid . . . line to order horrible , we waited forreevveerr . . . and eventually went to wrap place across food court which had better service and same type of menu .
Poor food and smells like smoke
這餐廳有很多連鎖店，我吃過很多家此分店食物是好的，但是這家餐廳的食物吃起來不新鮮，食物好像是已經放一些時間了，不新鮮有些糟糕，我不會再來這裡，但是服務人員是親切好的！
Apparently they close because the worker just waved me off sitting on a chair outside .
Server doesn ' t have any patience at all very grump , food wasn ' t good ribs was hard and not cook properly , the brisket was ok
I had lunch here , and ordered a grilled salmon sandwich . The food had a smell so bad that i could not eat it . I will not go back
expensive soggy grilled cheese sandwich
Strange place . . . Rocking club like music with a pretty big Italian menu . We ordered the pizzas which were just ok .
Advertises that they buy & sell , but never has time or can make an appt to buy or look at items . Too much of a run around . Last trip there .
I got a dortmunder , no problem there . I got nachos , ( chorizo & chicken ) no good at all . Bland , very very bland .
Terrible customer service . Bus delays and lack of communication . Would not recommend .
Friday night atmosphere is 2nd to none , food and drink sucks , not the staffs fault . the bar is incredible looking , get your act together
Delivery was an hour late and when I call the restaurant l , no one picks up the phone to explain . Super bad service .
The delivery guy took 20 minutes to find my address and he missed part of my order , pizza was cold
Service was great but the food was so salty especially the potatoes that came with everyones breakfast . I felt sick all day .
Update , they LIE too . Promised no bill for August , they charged me for visit where there idiot again did not clean pool . YOUR FIRED .
very cheap meat there was a lot of fat in my dish & the chicken was very very dry . i couldn ' t eat them . never again !
This place sucks to get food early in the morning . The attitude from the big guy at the window shows .
I like PetCo , but the staff was very unfriendly at this location . I won ' t be back to this store . Metro Center is much better !
Food is decent . I just didn ' t love my experience here on a Sunday . Maybe I ' m too old .
Guess you need to be white to be served here . Practice customer service cause it sucks badly .
Good quality bikes and accessories , but way overpriced and the staff are very arrogant and unresponsive . On two separate occasions , i circled the store with no one asking me for help until 10 mins later .
I do not recommend . Never on time , no follow up . Fountain stopped working after one month . No return calls .
Wrote in a mediocre review about their food quality and they appealed to Yelp to have it removed . Therefore I wonder if the reviews are selective .
Food was so k but an 830 last call ( not the first time for us ) is horrible . Servers act as if there doing you a favor . . . I am very over it
