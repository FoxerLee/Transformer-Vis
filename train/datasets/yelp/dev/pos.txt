周末请饮茶，听讲唔错，琳住吃好d就选择离呢度。12点几仍然要等位，假期无办法啦。门口入去大厅会见到隐蔽鱼缸养住鲜活大皇帝蟹和大龙虾。餐馆大厅几大气，高大上，特别是寿司吧的位置。可能晚左离，想试招牌点心黑金流沙包卖晒了，点了黑金奶油糕，其实就系黑芝麻糕加奶油，因为都几大一件，好饱肚，少少痴口。翡翠杂菌饺和樱花虾墨鱼卖都ok . 可口萝卜海鲜馃原来系炸既，少少热气。价钱稍微偏贵

When they say spicy , it is really spicy , by Asian standards , we love this place !
delicious and unique . Worth a stop for anyone looking for a special treat or to try some authentic french desserts .

I heart Starbucks ! ! ! Especially this location ( : the employees here are the best . They work really hard and are always so nice . Keep up the good work guys !
The food is good , the quac is amazing , the place is super tiny so you are going to have to wait . The quac alone is worth the wait to experience it .
Ever since they remanaged this place . It has been great servers have good customer service and the food is pretty good . The noise level is above average . But they have no control over that really .
The food and service isn ' t as good as the location on 32nd NE but im glad there ' s a location on 17th for when I want grilled chicken .
My husband and I went in to get a massage and infared wrap and we had a bast . This was both of our first times experiencing any massage let alone a thermal wrap
The soup has a rich flavour of onion and cheese . The plain bread from the bread bowl balances well with the rich flavour of the soup . This is good .
Great service , gorgeous rooms , but they really need to soundproof the rooms . Train kept me up atl night .

Clean , professional , and lacking in the more - punk - than - though attitude prevalent at some other studios . Jenny is amazing .
入店時に精算用のカードを手渡され、好きな席に座り、キッチンやバーに好きなものを買いに行きます。 ワインが豊富。 パスタは麺の種類がえらべ、ピザはナポリっぽい感じで美味しいです。 サラダの味もなかなかでした。 カジュアルで、でも美味しく気軽に入れるお店です。 帰りにカードを精算します。 なのでチップも不要。 お一人でもどうぞ。
Good food made by owner . Meat shop that ' s local Clean , but it is a meat market . Friendly , nice atmosphere

I came here based off of the other yelp reviews and was very happy I drove the extra few miles ! Vivian helped me , had me seated and out within an hour and my nails look awesome !
Their tiramisu is THE best in town / Phoenix area ! Their pastas have gotten a lot better I think . The only Italian restaurant I would go in fountain hills !

Good quality sushi ! The rolls looked dull though , I wish the presentation was better ! Otherwise a decent sushi restaurant with an authentic vibe to it !
Great for a relaxing comfortable breakfast . Service is always great . We go often . However we would go a bit more often , but it is a little overpriced for what you ' re getting .
Best authentic korean food in Christie . Highly recommended . The price is excellent considering the food you get .
Misu pork belly was delicious ! Food is authentic , staff was slow , but food was worth the wait . Refills didn ' t happen which is why I gave 4 stars

The atmosphere is nice , clean surroundings , soulful music in the background . Our waiter was excellent . The food reminds me of my mothers cooking . I will be back .
Delicious as always . Drive thru was a bit slow . Not the restaurants fault I believe . Someone must have change / added to their order and screwed us all .
Great GF crepes . The Paris 66 crepe was very flavorful and filling ( ham , Swiss cheese , fried eggs , tomato sauce ) . We sat on the heated porch .
Great service and authentic tasting . Little pricey but has great flavors . Nice and clean new place . The old restaurant burnt down so it ' s newly remodeled . Must check this place out .

The tempura shrimp was absolutely awesome ! It was priced according and the environment was relaxing for a quick lunch .
I loved the experience ! The environment seems like a Great Gatsby place , not too big , wich for me is good . The food is very delicious and different in a good way !
$ 1 games from midnight - close ! can ' t beat that price !
If their coffee was as wonderful as their donuts , I ' d give them five stars for sure but I find their hot brew to be a disappointment every time .
Went for a late lunch and had Eggplant parm is good , I also had a side salad . The server was very kind .
Great with my two children 4 and 2 . 5 . Good hair cuts but only 4 stars because I feel like it was a little over priced for the service .
Great place for a quick lunch . The subs are pretty good , and the staff is very friendly .
consistant quality service at a fair price . I wouldn ' t spend the money on the shave as they use the cheap 2 edge bic razors but for a mens cut you won ' t be sorry .
I ' m from out of town and this was a nice quaint store . Checkers were friendly and produce guy was helpful
Cool little Mexican spot right in a center with other nice bars and restaurants . Nice and cozy good drink specials and food and they have happy hour throughout the week .

Good option for airport fresh mex . Good was hot and fresh despite being almost 9pm . Service was friendly and efficient despite it being busy .

I ' ll be back . . . this place is perfect for a date or small groups of friends . They take their menu and food seriously . Love it !
Really run down and dirty clothing store . But , good variety and prices . Worth a look .

Iconic part of Pittsburgh . A must visit and see place .
double decker grilled cheese & lots of kitsch don ' t let the singers get too close
Service was superb and excellent ambiance . Bento boxes and the brunch burgers are awesome . Sushi quality is not good despite the presentation . Eastern drop cocktail was overly citrused and unpleasant .
Other than the fact that the quality of their side dishes has gone down over time , everything else about this place is really great : D
Excellent , the flavors were fantastic . I got the chicken milanese , which i would get again next time I am here . There is little parking , they had valet when we went .
Don ' t believe the haters . If you enjoy a relaxed urban vibe , this place and the neighborhood surrounding it are really nice .
Great food ! They are kinda slow and cheap on sauces . You have to eat everything INCLUDING rice for the all you can eat plates !
Had a good time with my boys . The place wasn ' t busy so we pretty much had the place to ourselves . I think we will all sleep good tonight .
I enjoyed graffiti Alley . If you like art you gotta take a walk here . There are tons of buildings with graffiti but this Alley has the most in Toronto !
Asked for a Don Draper style haircut . Did it well with a good length to play around with . For $ 11 , will definitely return .
Spicy fish fillet was very delicious and flavorful . spicy chicken was good and spicy . shredded pork was not good . . overall an authentic sichuan food .
Love the Loco Moco & Ramen ! And I really like that I can make reservation online and do not need to line up ! The staffs there do not say much , but they are polite .
I ordered the Lamb Gyro and some Chicken Wings . I thought they were both Pretty Good . I will order from them again soon , but I think I will try the Pizza next time .

The price is good and the food is good for what you pay . The service is ok . They are little busy in the weekends but on week days it ' s so calm .
Good food , great drinks and yummy deserts - its like Olive Garden for the Island Fare .
Not a bad place to hang your hat in Green Valley . The slots seem to pay OK . I live closer to Red Rock but find this location to be better .
Perfectly simple menu ! The chicken was not oily but crisp and tender . The sauce had perfect spice to it and the Lemonade was refreshing !
Was out riding on the motorcycle . Stopped by for the 1 beer I ' m allotted . Had the Fish & Chips . I usually stop by every month or so .
Traveling through town , stopped for quick bite . Gyro was almost more than I can eat , and very tasty . Good service . Would come back for sure .
No frills lobster roll sandwich . Mayo and as much lobster meat they can stuff in a hot dog bun . $ 17 . On the northeast corner of las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street in Downtown .
Okay sushi . Nice environment . Ordered green dragon , candy crush and twice cooked . salmon roll . Not a fan for candy crush roll , like the other two .
Just had them do a used car check for a car I was interested in . They got us right in and told us everything we needed to know . Fast service and was less than $ 60 .
Lunch can get busy so order ahead and pick it up . Must gets are yuca fries and plantains . The sauces are a perfect compliment to the food . The green sauce is my favorite !
Great place we are frequent visitors Fish manchurian dry with extra spice and chicken Hakka chow mein are our favourites . Recently we ask for less oil as too much oil is used in dishes

Very unusual breakfast sandwich ! Nice room , a little noisy , very busy on a Saturday morning , but worth the wait .
タイ料理屋さん。 夕食分と朝食分を持ち帰りで注文。自分、日本人なんだけど、辛さはどのくらいが良さそう？って聞いて、ミディアムにしたんだけど、ミディアムでもだいぶ辛かった。。。もいちょい下のランクにしても良いかも。 でも、麺もカレーもどちらも美味しかったので、また行きたいお店。

Great place especially if you bring the whole clan and get the meat and veg combo plates to share . Very nice server as well . Lemoncello cake was the only disappointment , just a basic lemon cake .
Workers are nice and the service is fairly quick . I just wish they wouldn ' t try to sell you everything . Just tell me what you think needs changing and let me decide

Dunkin , your 99cent medium iced coffees were heaven sent . Please bring them back .
In love with their Stetson Chopped salad with salmon literally have never tried anything else .
Very interesting food . You combine three or four small dishes . They have different variations of meat , vegetables and lentils . You eat with your hands and use a special type of bread as silverware .

It was a nice little Japanese fusion cafe . It was a little pricy for the stuff they give you though for lunch on a weekend . The food and quality was good though .
Great food ! The chicken , both the roast and the fingers are fresh and juicy . One caveat , kinda pricey for what is essentially fast food .
It ' s great to see a true Korean restaurant come into Charlotte . The staff is awesome and the food is great . Just wish the meat would come marinated already .

Houses The Light Factory and McGlohn Theater . Saturday during the Wells Fargo Community Event was the first time I visited this place . Glad I did !

Visited five times per week , chicken sandwich is better than whataburger , although have no idea why chicken sandwich is expensive than beef burger . . .

附近来讲算ok大间的tim hortons , 系huntingwood同warden交界的东南角，隔离系间大大的shoppers drug mart . 停车位都几多。柜台有三个下单区。因为呢间座位多，不少人都会离呢度做下功课开下会甘。门口刚好分隔左两边座位区，并提供洗手间可用。所以几适合聊天地方，不错的。
Surprisingly casual and terrific food .
They service my car when needed . Flexible appointments and friendly . Not always sure the price I pay for the " recommendations " is fair , but overall no complaints .

原来呢度都有喜茶，finch and midland美兰中心的皇茶就有埋喜茶，真系唔入去都唔知，有点惊奇。不用排队之余，仲好多座位tim , 还有免费wifi . 饮品品种一点都不差于国内，芝士芒芒和桃桃都好饮，前者好浓，有轻微芒果肉口感，后者就清新蜜桃比较突出到茶味。价钱方面少许贵！
No line , no cover charge or dress code . . Great music . Drinks are expensive though . . .
4 . 5 Stars The seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good . Very expensive . Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach .

This is one of the best local hole in the wall burger spots in town . Excellent burgers , fries . They are those greasy burgers that are so good . Family Check this place out .
ローストビーフと言えば . . . やっぱりローリーズですね。日本にもお店がありますが、本場で味比べしてみました。お店の作りは、LA店と同じくらいの広さかな？でも、独特のユニフォームを着たウェイトレスさんは、ラスベガス店の方が若いかも ( 笑 ) ローストビーフは、切り方 ( 厚み ) によって呼び名が異なり、カートがテーブルサイドまできて、そこで切り分けてくれます。もちろんですが、焼き加減も聞いてくれます。 ローストビーフということで、僕はいつもミディアムレアなんですが、一緒に行った方が、ウェルダンを頼んで、それがやけに美味しそうに見えましたので、次回はウェルダンを試してみます。 ワインも豊富で、ナパのワインを頼みましたが、バッチリでした！
Looking for a quiet lunch 15 minutes away from the strip ? I highly recommend Marche Bacchus . Delicious food , decent portions , great service , soothing lake views .

I stopped by to get a haircut , I was seated right the way , no wait time . the hair dresser was very nice , she did a great job !
Moe ' s is always good except the pop machines don ' t work always like they should and they switched to dark meat chicken instead of white meat so that sorta sucks .
Love this place , cool , hip , lots of downtown folks in there for lunch . It mellows out for dinner . Really outstanding food . I recommend it !

Lunch review . Simple . Ok Svc - not night time quality Svc but decent . Menu limited . this is really just a simple lunch - not worth making a trek unless your already nearby .
An urban twist on Mexican food with some unique and delicious recipes . Great food , nice decor and large portions . You won ' t regret trying this one .
Fantastic show for hetero couples . Easy to find low priced tickets , too !
I had some brownies there and it ' s a must do for chocolate lovers ! The atmosphere was cozy and the staff really friendly ! A little but overpriced , though .
This place is in our neighborhood and I am glad to have something nearby ! They are always kind and make us feel they car for our dogs .
Legit dark roux seafood gumbo . Fried shrimp Poboy was the bomb . Authentic bread expertly fried seafood with remoulade sauce . Wife had grilled shrimp kabob with rice and beans . Delish with fresh grilled veg .

This is the real deal . Pad Thai was perfect . Sour , salty with just a touch of sweetness . Panang was great as were chicken and noodles .

The food here was really tasty - I had the shrimp and crab tortellini . However , the service was super slow .
Pizza was very good , although for the price they could be a little more generous with the toppings .

The food was amazing ! Really nice lunch special that will leave you full ! Easy parking and great prices . Also a very large desert menu .

Sitting in room waiting on Bell Desk to answer . Would like to gamble . Bugsy might want my money , but his bell help apparently are busy . 25 plus minutes waiting . . . .
Upscale dimsum dining with fast ( ! ! ) service and better quality food . Their congee with fish and cilantro captured my parents ' hearts ; the fish is delicious and the congee is finely flavoured .

The food was awesome . The service was a little off , but not bad by any means . I would recommend this location to others .
Old - school family owned and operated . Thus they care about their product , and it shows you can taste it . I just wish they would stop calling me sir when I make my phone orders .

We got a $ 50 a night deal from Hotwire , and we enjoyed our stay . The only negative were the late night dining options , and ridiculous price for wifi .
Not bad . . . older machines , but my clothes got clean , not like Rancho Dr . Laundromat , clothes felt gross and smelled nasty ! This place was good !
Very cool ambiance and probably one of the better places in Phoenix . Beef stew was okay ( tasty but hard to differentiate from other stews ) . Prawn appetizer was awesome . Service is sweet
This place is good but kind of pricey , However they ALWAYS show up happy with a smile & have great customer service . Don ' t sleep on the Philly cheese steak it is so goooood !
Even if you aren ' t gf or vegan it is worth stopping in for a sweet treat . The lemon raspberry donut only made it as far as the car ! Lol .
Really tasty food at a good price . Service is relatively quick too !

Nook is a nice addition to downtown - - nice enough for a more formal business lunch or dinner and featuring an interesting menu . Attentive service .
good atmosphere pre game . seemed solid to me . good burger , fries and beer . wasnt overly crowded so maybe a lot of the complaints about service were not seen by me .
Still a fan - went there for apps and wine the other night . The bartender from Flemings works there now . Anthony . He ' s pretty good - check it out when you get a minute .
Great sushi bar . Really interesting and different rolls on their sushi list . Can ' t wait to go back when they are approved for beer and wine .

One of the best breakfast in Vegas ! The banana nut muffins are a must ! I also had the chili relleno omelet which is awesome . Very happy !

pretty good , got the soybean tofu soup and finished all of it except the pork . wish there were veg soup options .
Best vegan burger in all of Gilbert ! Hands down . Now they just need to serve wine and get rid of the flies .
This subway is great because it is right next to my apartment . Their is nothing special about this subway but them being open 24 hours ! That ' s great and I love it .
Great hotel , room was clean and a great price for 2 nights , we enjoyed the coffee in the room and it ' s less busy away from the strip
Clean facility . Nice staff . Great classes . The basketball court seems to have pick up games . The indoor pool looks barely busy . Just right for getting in and out to do your workout .

Good bar food from the burgers , salads and breakfast . The food didn ' t take long and calling in carry out was fast and easy .

The food here was pretty good and came in a somewhat large portion . I ordered the pork tenderloin and it was great with the mashed potatoes . The bartenders are cool and the drinks are good too .
This place rocks ! I have been to several locations and the food is nothing short of great . It looks like food from a high end restaurant but the price is very lunch worthy .
Pineapple smoothie 50 % sweet is yummy . Would give 5 stars if they used real fresh pineapples . Made from concentrated juice .
Food was excellent , even as carryout . Unfortunately the service has been very slow the two times I ' ve visited . Carryout order on a non - busy time took 25 minutes for cheese burgers .
I like the place . I found this place from yelp about two weeks ago and have been back more than 5 times .

Love the food . Fast service . Sometimes too crowded to get a seat . Recommend spicy shrimp and vegetable fried rice .
Good service and good food . Eat in the bar if you need to get in and out a bit quicker .
They seem to have a really huge selection of furniture , however a lot of it is overpriced as well . Some of the decorations are reasonably priced but aside from that it ' s not too bad .
The soup is delicious . The reason for one star off is you must spend $ 20 . 00 For one person who likes to buy one bowl of soup this is kind of crazy .
I thought the prices here were very reasonable , and the teriyaki bowl was delicious : the meat was very tender and the vegetables were fresh and crisp . I hope they expand their menu in the future .
Good options for America food ! The quesadilla and fries , pricing was not too bad for the vegas strip .

Clean , fast , friendly , nicest subway in the area .
Great sushi . I ' ve been coming here for the past 5 years . Their service can be a little slow at times , especially weekend nights . However the rolls & sushimi are top notch .
Pretty good . Overall , I seem to not like the Fox restaurants , but this one is OK . We did a beer dinner here once , too , and it was fantastic .
The wraps here ( both vegetarian and meat - based ) are all delicious . Personally , I think they could stand to be slightly more substantial , given the price - point ; highly recommended nonetheless .
Nothing fancy but we really like the food here . Prices are reasonable too . Highly recommend them for take - out or a quick meal .
Great selection , best in town . Great edibles to choose from , wide variety of flower , thank you !
good portions and their salad is a lot fresher than what you ' d get from chains like jimmy the greek . their entrees are almost double the price though .
Mucho buritto is almost always our Calgary fast food of choice . Both of us got a small veggie burrito it was stuffed right full and tasted great .
I love the cannolis ! ! ! If you like thin New York style pizza this is your place to go .
Have stopped here a hundred times on the way home from the in - laws to get my wife a mcflurry , and me a shake . Always get fast service .

Went on a weekday for breakfast . Selection is limited but it was pretty standard breakfast . But i will say their crossiants were delicious . Go for the pastries ( in the morning when fresh )

Nice place and really nice owners ! The chaat and dessert / sweets are just awesome . However , too many times overcharging errors leave a bad taste .
Simple paperwork , no hustling BS . Pretty much any size unit available at competitive prices .
Large menu . We all have different meals and even the kids liked their meals . I personally like it spicier , but that ' s why they have hot sauce .
As far as I know if you want a smoothie this place is the best all the other ones taste like crap . I get a 16 Aloha pineapple with 3g boost and it ' s bomb .
Best place for shakes ! Love the big burgers
The theme is Duck Hunt . Picture the game in modern settings . Video games with guns . Not real ones ! The old Fox and Hound looks good . The mac and cheese bites are great too !

It is not the Ballantyne Spa . . . so if you ' re pretentious . . . go elsewhere . I had a great experience and will definitely be going back !

某微信公众号看到有推荐呢间咖啡店的黑炭咖啡唔错，且分店都几就脚。午餐后就看住导航去探店啦。门面看落唔大，一共有3层。一楼系吧台和收银，洗手间在负一层。二楼是一般的客座，几舒适，环境几好。3楼应该是包房吧，可以预约作为派对或开会场地。黑炭咖啡看落似芝麻糊甘，饮落有杏仁香味，因为用杏仁牛奶冲。几香滑，而且饮完挂杯。虽然比其他连锁店的咖啡贵少少，但真系好饮好多

Great restaurant on the ground floor of The Bay . Had the chicken pot pie which had a puffed pastry crust that was perfectly browned . Really delicious and nice comfortable decor .
Service was great and the food tasted amazing . It was real spicy genuine Chinese food . If you love spicy food , this is the place to go !
Pork tenderloin was nice . Ancho rub chicken was so delicious . Do yourself a favor and order a Black Widow cocktail ( shirley temple mojito goodness ) .
Cute little hole in the wall ! Tasty lemon sorbet and nice seating next door . Perfect for a hot summer day : )
My second time here and I have to say its one of my favorites . Had the ribeye and enchiladas everything was delicious , perfect dinner .
Good small town diner , both the broiled and beer battered walleye was yummy . Go all in and get the fried cheese Kurds and malted milkshake
Just wanted to mention that sekai does , in fact , have a modest liquor selection . It ' s not just beer and wine .
Very good tacos , guacamole is why I came . Great , just too little for the $ 6 . 00 ( 1 / 2 an avocado ) Chips are fresh and plenty . Real nice place .
This place has a nice selection of freshly baked pastries . For all the cinnamon bun lovers : they make the best ones in town !

Very good pizza , chipotle style order , friendly customer service , fresh ingredients , thin crust , loved it . . . . .
I think the food is comparable to , if not slightly better , than Gojo on Thomas . But Gojo is so much cheaper . Doro wat should come with an egg .

The Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon , served with a mushroom - ancho chile sauce , was heaven . Need I say more ?
Very expensive but wow . Incredible food . Just keeps coming nonstop . Amazing for a special occasion .

Delicious pizza , delivered faster than expected . Much better than your generic dominoes / pizza hut . Recorded for a delightful dinner / late night snack .
I believe this hotel and casino are priced fairly . You get what you pay for so enjoy the show you can also enjoy the freemont

Better stocked and super deals on clearance items . Easy returns . Friendly , helpful staff .

Great attentive service . Prompt service . Crust is crunchy with air bubbles . Sauce is heavy on the tomatoes . Kids enjoyed it too . Overall a good dining experience .
Nice vibe overall . If you are a visitor like me and live nearby , it would be a nice place for breakfast / brunch . Servers are polite . Foods are just normal even too oily .
Came in for oil change on a whim . They were nice and friendly . Got me in and out in 1 hour . Not too bad . Will come again .
Beautifully designed space with a cool communal table . The soy latte I got was just right , and served in a small glass . The cookies looked delicious .
Was craving a fresh salad and I got exactly that . Tons of veggies , light dressing , super fresh greens . The chicken was grilled to order . Pretty perfect lunch .
Great pancakes and delicious eggs , but the diner felt a bit dingy and dirty . It could definitely use a facelift , and expect a wait .
Good Food Good Friendly , Hostes and Servers . They actualy check up on you a minuit or two after your foods been deliverd . Open late . I will return many more times .
They were super nice and accommodating . I had a chickpea wrap and it was very filling . My only issue is the parking - had to spend 1 . 50 to park .
Probably the best jerk chicken in pickering . Very flavourful . Been a few times and will go back
Good pizza , good salad , a bit pricey but they have good specials . Quick service and clean areas . Pretty solid place and in my opinion better than Mellow Mushroom across the street !
Great place to hang out and drink beer , you can play pool , the staff is nice , good music .
Awesome Quick Meal . . : ) Great Joun ' s . . Definitely Check it Out ! New Jem in Scarborough ! !
It took a while to get our food but EDNA was the absolute BEST ! She was clearly working under pressure and was SO kind and organized and worked as fast and efficient as she could .
Had the smoked turkey salad today and the mac and cheese . Salad was great as I picked the ingredients . Their smoked turkey is quite good ! Hubby had the brisket sandwich also good !
Stopped in for a quick meal . We had a small jerk chicken and a chicken roti . Great service , very good food and very good portions . Definitely would stop by again .
Nice place , visited with the family and tried many plates from the menu , plus the samosa . I loved the garlic sauce and the fact that they have it added by default .
I ' ve been coming here for years . I either get beef , spring rolls and vermicelli or pho . The food is consistently good and the waitresses have all been nice . I highly recommend it .
Big on desserts , just wanted coffee . They had opening problems with orders , they are new , if they can fix those issues , and get some healthy choices they will be good .
A little on the expensive side for lunch , but the made to order gyros are fresh and delicious . Comes with 4 ingredients included , extras will cost you .
Great food . Just visiting from Seattle and the " prickly chicken " has me ready for the whole AZ experience .
So tasty ! Went here before a show and got the burger and a vodka cran ! Tasty ! Boyfriend got the bbq chicken . Large portions but so good ! ! ! ! ! ! !
I mostly get coffee here . They are very quick and friendly . Everything is organic . The baked goods are tasty but quite expensive .
Roti was served steaming hot . Chicken satay was honey coated , but cut in very small pieces - - got 5 long skewers . Very tasty !
First time trying Vietnamese food , had the chicken phó , and it was really good , and I don ' t think you really need to get a drink because the cucumber water is really refreshing !
Would definitely stay here again . Great rooms - - clean , all the amenities , huge bathrooms , nice decor . The breakfast was great and the staff extremely helpful . Top tops all around .
Excellent food , amazing that it ' s vegan . Would have rated a 5 star but the service at lunch time is seriously lacking .
The sushi here is delicious , there are many different selections and they ' re all SO GOOD ! ! the only thing that sucks baaaad is the service .

Get the nachos . . . . they ' re awesome . . . good salsa selection too
Reasonable price , well trained service and very convenient location right at the monorail stop even away from loudness and busy street . The whole place is kinda old compare to other Vegas hotel though .
A little pricy . Enjoyed visit though . Lots of fun . Bald guy with beard in the band the best . Bartender was very friendly although never caught her name
Have had thai in a lot of different cities and Yupha ' s is one of the best . Tried the bbq chicken and the pad si ew . Both were great . Terrific service too .
This is great place to pick up dessert after dinner . The place had a long line but well worth it . Variety and flavor choices were great .
environment is good , food is wonderful , and the price is comparable . My dad love it , will come back .
Great snack , lots of flavors , about 180 calories for a 6 ounce serving , so still healthy and a nice dessert .
Great atmosphere and decent prices during Happy Hour . . . I just wish there were some additional options for snacking since all that drinking can make you hungry !

I like this place for take out - - love their salad dressing ! Get the gyro Greek salad . Yum ! !
This place is a gem . How many authentic diners are left ? Good food and good service at very reasonable prices . It deserves 4 . 5 stars .
The service and food are technically 5 - star but the combinations are so unusual it was tough to find the rounded meal I expect . Almost no vegetarian options .
This hotel is great especially for the price . Very clean with very comfortable beds . We love this hotel and will stay here every time we visit our family in Arizona .

I love the quality of meat , you know its not for the all you can eat korean bbq grill meat quality . I just wish they had combos .
We had dinner there and the environment was nice . I ordered their special which was a filet salmon with mushrooms and goat cheese . Didn ' t like the goat cheese but the flavor was very strong .
Great place , Loved that fact that the hookahs were clean and the tobacco was fresh . It was a young crowd , but they didn ' t mind an old timer like me hanging out . lol

Consistent delicious goodness as the other location ( s ) . Can ' t go wrong with their wontons .
This is a fun place to see a show or grab a drink . So glad it opened in downtown Phoenix !

Very good dinner . We had a nice time . The eggplant parm was very good ! We will be back .
Was a nice evening overall . Food was good drinks as well . Staff could have been more attentive . I would say nothing bad but nothing outstanding . Still is a good choice if the opportunity arises .
Same concept as Fogo de Chao in bigger cities , but much more affordable . Amazing cuts of meat and amesome salad bar . The live jazz in the background was an unexpected treat !
Great food for great prices ! Their Green Curry is my absolute favourite in the city . Not to mention their delivery is very speedy and arrives in very pretty packaging , bonus !
One of my favourite spots on Roncy . The Chicken po boy is fantastic and their burger is one of my favourites . Great selection of beer and the steak night special is sooo good and cheap !
Was pretty good but overpriced for what you get . We both ordered a steak salad and the amount of meat we each got was less than 3 oz .
One of the best places to get chimichanga ' s imo . The Chicken chimi , Carne asada chimi , and Bean & Cheese chimi are usually my own picks !
good food , good prices and good atmosphere - all adds up to more than just good . try the " unnumbered " lunch special . . . . 13 bucks gets you a whole heap of tastes !

Surprisingly good food . From the name we didn ' t expect this variety . Best smoothie ever !

Tried this place out for the first time . Pretty good and the employees were friendly . We did have a discrepancy with our order but it was handled professionally and quickly no longer an issue . Thanks !
Sandwich is good but the bottles that have the sauces in them really need to be kept clean . Drippings and caked on sauce on bottles is not appetizing !
Very delicious ramen , cake was on the expensive side but very yummy as well ! Was surprisingly full for 3 pm on a Thursday , but we were quickly seated after a short wait outside
Mad Greek . . very good authentic Greek food . Very easy going environment . Sometimes the food is on or off , my only complaint but usually on .

This joint is cool to visit . The area around Tempe is beautiful and the food is good here and customizable . The beer - Rita is worth a try and the overall scene is fun to experience

Great happy hour and live jazz music ! ! Really enjoyed the Seared Ahi Tuna and side salad . Great service and ambience .

Cozy coffee shop . Came here to satisfy my sweet cravings . Mission accomplished . Cakes and Pastries are delicious .

This is the real deal banh mi place . The Pho Tine fries are really good . The best sandwich is the Porchetta . Great service with quick delivery .

Sesame Inn has 4 locations . Station Square is the worst of all . I generally avoid this one but love the other 3 . Still much better than most Chinese around town .
A little noisy , but good fusion if you aren ' t looking for some real Japanese . But , hey they have karaage and edamame so it ' s somewhat legit . Be ready for the performances .

Good customer service , fast turn around . I always bring my truck here for smog and oils changes
I mainly go there for sashimi at lunch for 15 bucks . If you have an urge , you can ' t beat the price for an AYCE : ) Sushi is ok , and waiters are nice .
Good sushi . Not as good ad RA but no wait . Last time we were there the service could have been a little better , but the food is always great .
Food is excellent . But hospitality leaves a lot to be desired . Still , with the lack of good choices in the area it ' s worth putting up with feeling like your presence is a pain .

Excellent , found it thru Yelp . Impressed upon my first visit , so I brought my wife last week . The cherry mac double stack burger was fabulous !
I ' m not 100 % sure if it is old , but this theater is definitely showing its age . Smaller location compared to others . Great if you wanna see a movie and avoid huge crowds .

Not a beer drinker but was able to stock up for company that is ! Nice guys ! Great selection of IPAs . I ' ll be back ! ! !
Lovee this place . It ' s kinda hidden in the Venetian . Garlic bread rolls are yummy ! ! If you like a sauceless pasta try the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio , it ' s just perfect .
Delicious food ! Pretty affordable and nice staff . Only negative is they charge extra for things like sour cream . . . .
Cute spot . The food was incredible ! I ordered toast and it had a lot going on . Eggs on top were poached to precise specifications ! Yummy coffee . Not the BEST service but friendly .
I only gave this a 4 star because it is not authentic Japanese but rather Korean owned . But the food is excellent , fresh and service polite and friendly .
Go here for lunch all the time , great place to eat if you ' re a vegan or gluten free . Service can be a bit hectic and inconsistent , but not that big of a deal .
yay ! QT Greatest gas station eva ! !
Excellent sushi and awesome atmosphere , the 1st boat in town I believe ? Took my friend from California here way back when and he loved it as did we ! You won ' t regret it !

I was very impressed , they actually had vegetarian " chicken " The lettuce wraps were very tasty . I would definitely come here again .
Happy hour is the best ! They do half price drinks and have a great appetizer menu . Don ' t miss out on the chicken lollipops and avocado potato skins !
Very clean and no fishy smell . We shared catfish , fries , shrimp and cevichi . All was prety good . The service is friendly and food came very quick . Wish the cevichi was cut smaller .

So happy that one in the East Valley has opened ! My stylist was Jessica and my blowout lasted ~ 1 week . I will definitely try again and request her next time .
I come here a lot . They are normally open late on weekdays . Always get the # 10 . It ' s amazing . They do have a other things but the choices are limited .
I came here with my boyfriend a year ago and its definitely a must - try ! I would recommend getting the creme brûlée if they still have it , its so good
