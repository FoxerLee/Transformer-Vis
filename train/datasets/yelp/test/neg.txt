Good food ( butter chicken was awesome ) and great service . . . . but the interior could use some improvement .
The meat was tasty but overall an average Korean BBQ joint . Didn ' t refill our side dishes .
It was okay , I ' ve had better . It didn ' t seem very fresh and it was pretty skimpy in the meat portions .
The food was ay okay . It was not hot just warm The tables were way too small for our party of four Yet the service was amazing
Not bad . Got meat magnificent and habenero wings . Enjoyed both of them . Also I was on travel so delivery was convenient . Solid meal .
This pizza walks a thin line between A - OK and drunken munchies .
Went to Chicago concert last night . Parking both getting in and out was fine . food and drink prices are on the high side for what you get . security is overboard , lines moved slowly .
They have been reopened for a year or more . Average food at a cheap price . Not bad if you are hungry and lazy like i sometimes am .
Average food for the price . Nice place and they were understaffed but we ordered what was recommended and weren ' t impressed . . . .
Coffee wise . Ok . Probably better if I had a fancy drink . Def not worth the wait for just coffee
I love their chicken wraps and the home made pub chips ! They are SOOO good ! I haven ' t tried anything else yet but I will be coming back
Reliable , fresh and tasy . The corn bread muffins on the salad bar are a treat .
Great atmosphere , food was excellent . My only issue is there isn ' t one person of color on the waitstaff .
Great to go for a playdate , occasion or something . Not really a " free time " thing , i recommend Krazy Air for free time . A good place for all ages overall .
Good food , good service . Impressed with the whiskey offerings !
We went the first couple weeks they were open . Pizza was lukewarm and cheese wasn ' t as gooey as I was hoping . Service was okay but nothing impressive .
good ambiance . . . food " looks " good but average in taste good hang out place though if you are not too picky about your food I would skip lobster next time
I love this place . But tonight i decided to order tapsilog and it didnt taste or looked like tapa at all . Very dissapointed . The rest of the food were still good tho .
Service was just adequate , not much for English . Food was delicious , the spicy pork was better than spicy chicken ( Lynn says ) . Might come back .
Not bad . . . The rolls are pretty good , I think a little overpriced considering we ' re in Vegas and we have a bast option of good quality and fresh seafood .
Food has no taste . Server was friendly but not enoughto return . Surprised by the good reviews .
It ' s a chain restaurant what do you expect ? . . . . . Chips and salsa to go . . . Watching the cowboys hot chips seems like good start
We ordered this late at night after an evening out an all 8 of us agree this was pretty decent pizza . Plain cheese pie delivered fairly quickly right to our hotel room for 13 bucks .
It ' s like an Italian chipotle . It ' s a great dining experience but wish they had more special dishes . . just feels okay not great . .
Typical Staples . It ' s big . They have what you ' d expect . Great location just off the 401 . Lots of parking .
The food is average and for the price it ' s not worth it . I guess it ' s only good for a one time visit ! ! ! ! !
Cafe , sandwiches y entorno promedio .
Not a bad place to grab food after a long night . Usually I ' ll grab a drink here and the service is good people are friendly
Good spot to grab a drink , bartender was very friendly and helpful , probably would have been better during the day , the night was was pretty dead and low key
Very good service but it feels like the palce needs a little longer time to settle in and some improvement of the food ! Had Buffalo Blue burger , fries and Salty caramel shake !
A genuine culinary adventure . Great menu with a unique and diverse selection . Be prepared for a wait on Sunday .
Chicken thigh appetizer was ok . Not what I expected , too much breading for my liking .
Nice staff but always running behind - way behind . Crowded waiting rooms . Nice docs but my time is valuable too so I can only give it 3 stars .
I honestly expected it to be a bit bigger but this is a really cute store to browse for that " just perfect " item .
Entertaining dinner option , but the staff turned our grill off a couple of times by accident .
Overpriced Denny ' s quality food but that ' s to be expected in Vegas . The menu is extensive though .
Food was average but an odd menu , found a hard time finding something to order that sounded good . Did not like the ambience . Small uncomfortable tables .
This is a good place to get a cheap meal . The food is nothing to write home about but it wasn ' t bad either and CHEAP ! I liked the fun atmosphere .
Had the seafood wonton knife - cut noodle soup and spring rolls . Very good flavor and extremely filling . Did feel a little rushed but I guess that ' s ok for a lunch .
Good shops , hard rock cafe , cinemas and guitar displays
Could be a 5 star if they would accept all credit and debit cards not just Discover . Decent produce selection . Friendly people working .
Drive thru takes a long time . Not sure if it was just a busy day but for drive thru they take too long . Tattoo covered girl keeps calling everyone honey like she knows everyone .
Not much choice on menu . Bands are great . Family friendly . Summer atmosphere great . Clean and seating ample . Parking pretty good .
Nice atmosphere good was sub par . Has a lot of potential . Didn ' t know how to make saki bombs lol
The service was good and they were flexible letting us use the Yelp check in offer .
Drinks good poppers good service great atmosphere good food ok not to good meat was over cooked . Other than that it was ok
Been going here my entire life ! Enjoy the staff , and the rapport i have built with my doctor .
The service was excellent , thank you Tamera ! The turkey burger I ordered was ok , it had carrots in it ( kind of weird ) but other than that it was pretty good .
Meh . . . . Expected a lot from Bobby Flays restaurant and it failed very short of my expectations . I have been to Chef Morimoto ' s in Napa Valley and the food was fabulous there
Rude service . I will never go back again . The food is also modified for whites , believe me it is not Indian food .
Good food . Good price . Good service . Nothing big . Got nachos and some tacos . It was ok . I will keep exploring the menu .
The food was great but the service was bad . Took forever to get our bill . Nearly walked out .
I was here years ago and it wasn ' t memorable . Unfortunately , it ' s still not terribly memorable . There ' s not specifically bad per se but it ' s just okay .
Place has been closed , and we have been waiting for this place to re open . Well we could have waited longer , food had no taste .
Good food if you like grease . Pours on drinks are lite , so order a beer if you ' re going to get drinks .
The food is pretty good but it is a bit overpriced in my opinion . The level of service I received has varied greatly on every visit . They do have some great healthy options though .
It was good , but way too pricey for what you get . I love supporting the mom and pop places and the prices are more reasonable .
Typical Taco Bell . 3 Supreme Tacos , 5 Layer Beefy Burrito and drunk . $ 9 . 50 . Stingy with the cheese .
Started with some appetizers , salads , and soups . . they sucked . Once the sushi came , things improved . Moral of the story , go here for the sushi .
Just your usual cheap buffet ! Hahah not the best quality of food but if you ' re into large portions go for it !
This place is better at being a bar than a restaurant . Food is mediocre at best .
First time here today . I ordered the Gyro Picado and while really tasty , was so greasy that the pita fell apart .
Okay food . Spanish omelet was smothered with cheap salsa . Service was quick and nice . Cute wait staff . Thought it was expensive for sit down American breakfast .
Nice place , good cocktails , slim beer selection . Didn ' t eat , but some of the food looked good . A nice break from the sometimes gross Fremont scene .
Love the outdoor patio . The beer is heavy IPA . There is not a huge selection of other types of beer
I have been blown away over the response from management at Mimis . I truly appreciate their sincere interest in correcting the situation . We will return
The theatre is good and I will say clean . I did not find the Imax theatre to be impressive . Overall this could have been any theater , anywhere . It was pretty nondescript .
Standard business travel stuff . pretty low end really . Convenient for CFPC but that is its biggest attraction
Its alright , but nowhere near as good as the original duffs in buffalo . Wings were a little oily and lacking on the sauce . What a disappointment since the one in ny gets 5 stars .
This place is closed now . I never even had a chance to try it . But it ' s closed ; newspapers on all the windows - darn .
My first golfing experience . Was doing pretty well until i got stung by bees on the 7 hole . i spend the rest of the time picking out the bee stings . Good driving range . b
多年无去帮衬啦，再去环境无太大变化，价格都好似差唔多甘 . 呢次照旧坐卡座，比较舒服。台够大。晚餐是5点开始，未够5点已经一堆人等开餐啦。点餐就用ipad点餐，更直观同方便。不过上菜速度有点慢，可能人手唔太够吧。刺身类唔错，三文鱼刺身好厚身，虽然唔算好肥美，但品质算系甘啦。推荐北极贝刺身，都ok大件，而且唔会比少。带子刺身成本高，所以一粒切成几小粒甘，不过都系鲜甜既。其他熟食类都可以，甘多年水平叫做维持到，算唔错架啦
CHEAP MEALS AT LIGHTNING SPEEEEEED ! ! ! How do they do it ? I ' m not sure that I want to know .
It was ok . . . Nothing great . It did the job . On 3rd floor of quad . . . 24 hrs i think .
Aha ! They finally got one Americano right ! If again , they will get one more star if they keep it up
Food was pretty good and our server was nice . It ' s a little far from the strip but was a nice change of pace .
Not too good not to bad They have a great selection of birds but half the fish are dead and in that section it smelled horrible today . I used to love going in here but now forget it
This theater is tucked away on LV BLVD which as a local should have been my first clue . Parking cost me 10 bucks which kinda irritated me . The theater itself is small but functional .
Good salad rolls and a very cozy , trendy vietnamese restaurant . Just not that blown away with the menu options .
Their service is not very good , the first tattoo appointment soon ，After each retach have to wait 2 year , attitude is very bad
Good small and busy bubbletea place right downtown at Yonge and College . Nothing special and not bad .
Soups are good but NEVER very hot in temperature . More like luke warm . Also I wish they had more gluten free options . It is nice to close to work although . Employees are friendly .
Teppanyaki at its most average . Good food . Understandable prices . You get what you expect .
Side dishes and bulgogi are delish . Must try if your around las vegas and craving for bbq !
Decent pick of clothes here . . but my kids say they have the worst toy selection of all the goodwill stores in the area .
Nice and speedy service . Decent Char Siu Bao , but other reviewers are right - the Dim Sum selection is a lot better in other Canadian cities .
I gave this a 3 because while the coffee was good it is very over priced for the only size they offer . $ 13 for 2 small coffees .
Been here twice . 99 cent margaritas are standard and what you ' d expect . Food is also standard . Price is right for the food .
Food was ok , service slow and not very friendly . Minimum length reviews is dumb . Dumb dumb dumb do I have enough characters yet ?
The crepes were very good . We had the apple and brie and the Mediterranean . What wasn ' t good was the 30 minute wait for those crepes and the fact that they ' re $ 10 .
I ' ve been to the Camelback location once . I ordered the cheeseburger which was ok . The diablo my wife ordered was very good . Will go back for the diablo
I came here and I ordered the grilled liempo and the barbecue pork with a naked salad and with pansit Canton . It came also with rice . Everything was totally delicious and I loved it so much
Pretty good fare , the way overpriced .
Very conveniently located , this spa has a few RMT and you can get an appointment fairly quickly . The downside is it doesn ' t appear very clean , however the quality of service is good .
cute store . everything is organized by color . nothing really caught my eye . no one was in the store at the time . everything seemed affordable . check it out
Decent sushi - Super power builder is solid . . . But for as large as an establishment and chain as it is , it ' s unbelievable they don ' t offer gluten - free soy sauce .
I mean that this place it ' s nice , nice atmosphere , nice service . As for the food , just meh .
Gets super busy . Wings are ok not the best . Service when busy is very slow . Price is good . Atmosphere is very cool . Loads of TVs for games perfect place to catch a game .
solid food . well prepared . I was not real big on the flavors I ordered but that was my fault . The wings were nice and tender . Be aware that they do not accept credit cards .
Starting off the food was good , great portion sizes , Lunch service was a little bit slow . Prices were average . Overall good place for a chill meal .
Dear Taco Bell , Please make you drive thru menu font bigger . I could barely make out any menu items .
Bartenders and clientele not as bad as a fart . Food is good . If you ' re looking for random stimulating conversation though , stay home and talk to yourself .
Nothing wow , it ' s just ok we had the benedictines far from being one of the best ones I ' ve tried . Washrooms are super dirty , it ' s disgusting .
Typical - a good glass of beer and so - so food . Also typical - the noise level - high .
Boy ! I need my money ! For first timers u need patience ! The wait I guess was worth it . Got there before closing so that was cool !
They changed the sauce . My friends and I used to go here in the 1980 ' s when wings was . 25 . Clean location . Fast service .
Low key cool vibe , asian fusion with heavy south asian influence . Nice but not fabulous . Fairly expensive but that ' s what one expects with a place like this .
Decent sausages . Can ' t say I ca taste the difference between the traditional and game sausages . Line ups can be slow . Beer is pricey .
This is a typical sports bar . The atmosphere is ok , nothing special and is kid friendly . The food is pretty good but nothing to rave about .
Tried sushi , salmon dinner and cram chowder . They were all fine . I liked the decore in the restaurant .
Centre commercial assez aere .
The one doughnut I had in the five times or so I ' ve come here ( I usually get a sammich ) it was very dry . But I like the quiet environment and the coffee .
Food was good but disappointed in how slow they were . I mean my cousins and I were the first in line and still waited longer then expected .
Too expensive to be a regular customer . Food is top notch . Very quiet and clean . Once and a while visit due to the price
The food was good and came out fast which somewhat made up for the lack of speed and urgency from the rest of the staff . A decent experience overall .
The seafood here is solid , but not anything special . The entrées was also kind of pricey
Not as bad as i was anticipating for a buffet . We had free vouchers so for that price you cant beat it ! Inly thing is they should have free wine or beer !
The potions have diminished ! Paid a lot for very little . Food was great but still felt ripped off !
service was very slow at 1 : 30pm and the restaurant was mostly empty . The food was just average according to my two Chinese friends
For a hyped celebrity restaurant , just okay . The service and food were solid , but I don ' t think they lived up to the hype or the price .
Great Sushi ! We have been going there on a regular basis for a year ! However the customer Service has gotten worse . They would receive a 5 star for food and 2 for service .
great waitress , but super slow service in the kitchen . It took forever to get our food and it wasn ' t even busy . probably won ' t go back .
The laffa was too thin so the sandwich kept falling apart . Service wise the place is great but food wise it is ok meaning that I will not go out of my way to return .
I took it there once and they fixed the screen but it didn ' t respond to touch , I lived all the way across town and had to take it back .
Decent on just about every front . Convenient location for suns games and events . Don ' t have high expectations for the food though .
Do not come on a Sunday . Long wait to get seated . The food was good but the dining room was loud . Hard to have a conversation .
The service was amazing . . however the maji maji tacos were over cooked and so dry . The shrimp and crab dip with pita chips is what redeemed my meal amd gave this place an extra star
Hooray for crazy Vegas prices and slow service ! It is Vegas , what do you expect ? But it is at least nice to have it around .
Not an awesome chinese but it is the best in Gastonia . Consistent good food and service . Not too expensive like the other gastonia chinese buffett . You cant go wrong
Excellent service from an incredibly friendly staff . However , the food was just okay .
RIP
Sushi was great but not very happy with their Grill food the rice is always mushy . . . But for the most part they have a good sushi selection .
We sat out on the deck and the weather was beautiful . The atmosphere there is wonderful . The food is just regular food . Nothing special . Therefore I give it a three .
Missing London ' s Fish & Chip shops we have been regulars here and are satisfied ! Portions are good and great customer service .
I don ' t know . I just got back a few minutes ago . The haircut was OK , but the blaring techno music put me off .
Not too shabby ! The spring rolls were fantastic and pho was pretty good . Service was friendly , place was clean . A decent experience all around .
Confortable and clean place with good and cheap food . I ordered a lemongrass chicken vermiceli for $ 6 . 99 . You can choose water or tea to go with for free .
The diner kebab was good and considering it was the only halal restaurant in the area . . . the menu items were not overly priced at all . . .
Healthy , quick and pretty good . Definitely a better and healthier choice than mcdonalds or any other fast food resturant
No sales here . Depends if you like the brand or not . I do like their style and clothing . Good quality . They support recycling and caring for the earth . Store is quite small .
Unfortunately this visit I was disappointed with my Beef Brisket sandwich . The meat was completely dry . The Mac & Cheese wasn ' t that great either . The chicken sandwich was good though .
Food is reasonable at a decent price . Just another Hong Kong style restaurant . It is a good place for group and family , and for quick and filling set meals .
Their gnocchi is absolutely delicious ! Their desserts aren ' t bad at all . . . But not the best Italian pastries out there .
Ate dinner here after a long drive . Good service and the employees were friendly and the cooks were really working hard . Got my food fast and it was great ! Will come back !
It is a nice place and service is good . The Taco ' s need some work . The empanadas are unique but just ok . Nice place but the food needs work .
Late nite meal . Gyro was a bit dry . Coleslaw and fries were great . Rice pudding was great .
They should change the name to SLOWMED ! ! 45 Minutes to urinate in a cup . Speed it up ! !
This place needs a thorough cleaning ! The drawer where napkins are kept right behind the cash register is filthy .
Equal to its downtown neighbor but in a less desirable location .
I know it ' s Vegas but this place is super expensive for food that ' s good not great , not worth the price ! You can spend $ 200 and I bet you leave hungry !
Typical breakfast , nothing fancy . Bacon was cold , hash browns cold , eggs steaming . I ordered the grilled chicken salad with corn and salsa . Somewhat bland , but simple and fresh .
It ' s a pretty good place for daily brunch . Great value . But it was under construction right now . Might be a little difficult to find .
Pretty impressed by this place . . . The food was excellent . Just the staff was very inattentive towards us . . . I would go there again
Food is pretty decent . They get super busy on the weekend nights . So sometimes when I call for pick up it could take 45 minutes to an hour to be ready .
This place is just ok overall , although drinks are generally impressive , food is also not bad , but service - wise , it fails ! Other details can be refined .
It ' s literally rock - n - roll ! I like how it was free before 12 and how it brings you back to the 80s ! The crowd is not that diverse , though .
Food was ok . Service was satisfactory . Restaurant was clean but the washroom was disgusting . I unfortunately discovered it at the end of my meal .
Not bad but overpriced as with anything else in the casinos . What you ' d expect from a regular burger joint . Pretty good bread .
Had some fried chicken for snack . Big portion size , however the regular flavour is too salty . If you go , I would recommend the spicy version , flavour is way better .
Visiting from California . Long wait to get my eye brows wax but the facilities were clean . The lady who did my eyebrows did a great job .
Great smoky flavored burger . Awesome chocolate shake . Crappy part of town . My fries were just okay . I was WAY hungover .
I like Winco the prices can not be beat but the staff need to work on their customer service skills , sometimes they are bit rude .
Wow what a show ! ! I couldn ' t believe a drag show would be that entertaining ! ! The host was funny and engaging as well . Very good stuff ! ! I recommend tyi
The line was long , the ice cream was ok . Not sure what the hype is about . They are open pretty late which is a plus
Food was ok and entertainment was awful . There was a male - female duo that slighted the experience , for sure . I ' m not encouraged to give it another try because the food was mediocre .
Tried twice & was really disappointed . Just up the street ( Eastern ) EGG WORKS is FAR SUPERIOR for breakfast / lunch foods .
Food was good ; however they wouldn ' t honor my 10 % discount from yelp on my breakfast . Waitress indicated it was only for dinner . Fresh fruit and omelette was good . Decent prices .
I understand that this place has a lot of traffic , but it looks and smells a little dirty
Good food for when you ' re in a bind . Bread made locally , tasty subs , ( usually ) fresh turkey .
Inside needs work . Service is awfully slow but I can ' t knock them there ' s only one cook always working there ! But the actual gyro is excellent and definitely worth the price .
Love this place ! Great food great service great vibes . The gat ages were always full and the tables look sorry though . Only complaint , otherwise I eat here all the time
We I have never been here before so we just gave it a shot . The food tasted okay but I had a chicken fajita Bowl that had about four small pieces of chicken in it .
these folks are usually super nice . . . but they get confused when I bring in my thermos to get filled with java . super convenient location .
The coffee is ok , a little on the weak side , and there are no refills . The muffins are consistently excellent so I will probably still come gere on the way to the withrow park farmers market
How can you write a bad review about warm , delicious cookies ? White Macadamia was amazing ! Warm , soft , and delicious with every bite . Check it out . Open until 3
Food good but wait time was ridiculous . Didn ' t get us even when there was a table available . Had to get a manager to get seated .
Staff is always helpful . Theaters for the most part are clean . Could do without all the punks . Prices about the same as everywhere else . . . high . Enjoy !
To me it was the typical bar style food , nothing exceptional but a nice place to hang out downtown .
Good breakfast , fast and courteous service . There are a variety of selections and the coffee is very good .
PUT UP SOME GOOD WINDOW SHADES ! Brutal sun exposure at sunset a . k . a . dinner time . The food was decent .
Well It ' s the strip ENOUGH SAID !
Chicken and yuca fries are great . I can ' t eat the rice or couscous because they put so many raw onions . Looking forward to trying more !
Not a bad place for an inexpensive happy hour . There was one bar tender , and it was not always easy to get her attention , but I would stop in again for the cheap drinks .
Average , not the best but a good fast food mexican joint of which there is no shortage in this town .
good for lunch with a good soup and salad bar . excellent lunch deal . good local food selection . nice outdoor seating on the lake . very friendly and helpful staff .
Food is amazing . But service could be more customer oriented . Had the enchilada stack and the pizza both were very well done . Satisfied my Mexican and pizza fix for the night .
Food is ok and it is kind of greasy spoon . . The decor is interesting .
Not too bad - the place was packed , music was jamming and everyone was having a good time .
Was good . Can ' t complain . The desserts were a little old . Shrimp was awesome . A little smoky was its at the casino so can ' t complain .
Food was ok , but with poor service and unfriendly staff it wasn ' t worth it . They messed up the number of people on our reservation as well .
Pretty good selection here considering the size of the store . Staff were very helpful in identifying that they didn ' t carry the product I was looking for .
A little too greasy for my tastes . However , the service is phenomenal and the Californian is great !
Service is the culprit , it ' s worse than average Chinese restaurant . All the waitresses have attitude issues . Food quality has slightly slipped but still ok .
Me & my girl go to this Outback quite a bit . The ambiance isn ' t the greatest , but we always manage to have a decent steak dinner w / drinks without breaking the bank .
Recently visited again , last time there , the women working in the morning were fantastic ! This recent visit , younger gals working , quite the opposite experience . Not very welcoming at all .
Good food and service , but could use a good cleaning and employees sit around texting . Average at best !
Not too bad , it covered the essentials for this trip . Make sure you go across the street to the Winking Lizard , great beer selection , friendly service , and food was pretty good .
Sophie ' s or spiros always feud about where to order in on pizza Fridays steady food just like spiros hmmmmmm wonder why ? : ) Still love the thin crust from pizza gaga , sorry guys .
Good steak . Friendly service . They even hold a weekly backgammon tournament on Tuesdays .
Great place to grab a coffee on the run . Its in a handy spot just as you leave the food - court .
Food is good , not great , but good to very good . If you need an Asian fix and you live in the area , it ' s the place to go .
Good restaurant . Better in the early days but still not bad today .
The coffee is solid but the service is mediocre at best . Very little service . The word hipster comes to mind . Seems as if they are bothered by your order
All the rolls were cold and kinda disappointing . Also my cat died . Charlotte is ok . Why do all my friends hate me ? The sushi was okay though .
Amazing patio , okay bar . Typical pub grub . Still during a hot summer day , I ' m a big fan .
low key place , good for conversation with others
Friendly wait staff . Authentic ingredients . However the shawarma are nothing like I had in Kuwait . The shish kabob is worth getting . Basmati rice needs some work . The market next door is great .
$ 28 for a pizza and salad , still leaving hungry . The pizza was very good though just seems a bit over priced for what they ' re selling .
Extremely slow service for being in n out . Found more than one hair in my fries and they looked old as fuck lol
Paid 90 bucks for a basic layers with bangs . Staff is friendly and helpful . They use Kerastase which is awesome . Probably won ' t go back as there was nothing special about the hair cut .
WOW ! Very nicely done . Nothing for men in my size . But I will bring the wife back as they had a lovely dress in the window that is " Oh so June Cleaver ! " ddc
Shawarma is not the greatest but chicken on rocks is amazing . Be careful about there sauce . It ' s way more spicer than other typical restaurants . Overall customer service was average .
Nice Mall GREAT Christmas spirit BUT parking is horrible
food when i got it was cold had to ask them to warm up my chilie . My talapia there was good but dry like no tomorrow . Look for something more inexpensive .
I don ' t remember eating here . Strange that I checked in .
Stopped by for dinner today and looks like it closed shop : ( We were all in disbelief !
Great service ! Food was good . The beef stew was delicious and so tender . Just wished it was a little more spicy . The chicken wings were also great !
Well drinks were weak and the pretzel bites , pizza and chicken fingers were nothing special . However , trivia night was a BLAST and the decor was right up my ally .
First time in and it was pretty good . Buff chicken wrap was very good but the temp cooled down with the sauce but not a deal breaker . Great prices .
Beautiful decor but way too expensive and service was just mediocre .
New clean organized . But packed on Sunday mornings .
I live walking distance . The prices are decent , and love the fact that it ' s none smoking ! No complaints here
I used to get pretty consistent tasting pho ' here but the last few times have been hit or miss so I am lowering my previous rating
Decent sandwiches and Indian dude was nice at cash register . Quick bite before our flight out . For airport food was good and clean . Kinda pricey but it is the Vegas airport .
Overpriced for what we ate the goats cheese salad was so so and the sweet potato fries overcooked . Service was friendly but slow Great patio
I love Thai food , but this wasn ' t my favorite . I asked for Medium but it ' s was distinctly mild . Probably wouldn ' t eat here again
very similar to all the other chain Mexican restaurants . . . nothing else to say
The Thai tea was good , the cashier was friendly , the wait was too long just for drinks and they need bigger straws !
Three stars for the great Lake view . But the food was too too sweet for me . But the plain beavertail is quite tasty , just the top up is sweet .
Clean , nice room a bit far from the strip .
Good sandwiches , especially the breakfast sandwiches which are served all day . However dont expect any grilled sandwiches or panini : (
worse than golden harbor , I think . Don ' t why my friends like it .
Service long et peu professionnel mais effectué avec gentillesse . La bouffe est correcte sans plus . Superbe cadre .
Good espresso drinks . The tomato - basil bagel was one of the worst bagels I ' ve ever had . I strongly recommend getting an espresso and moving on .
Good food , had the BBQ Chicken sandwich but only complaint about it was it tasted a little salty . .
We ' ve been trying better veggie and vegetarian dishes . Maybe it ' s not what we expected although we had been excited a lot .
Ok food , nothing special . It is just like every other Asian restaurant that caters to American taste . Not worth the money .
Been here once . Pretty fun little place . Kind of trashy peeps from time to time but otherwise a good time . Have not tried the food as of yet . HH is good though .
Nice facility but inconvenient . The ball fields are never available to members . I thought the YMCA encouraged being active
If you can deal with their horrible customer service long enough to complete your order , you will enjoy some very delicious food .
more selections on meat ! customer service is good . my only complaint is the price . A little more than other korean places .
Good food . Cozy atmosphere ! I would recomend this pub . The beer is well kept and the pub is atmospheric . On the whole good value , $ 5 lunch special every day !
Cheap , Hong Kong - style , upstairs , dirty , but decent food , friendly service , Cantonese soap operas playing in background . Would go again .
Bike night Thursday . Drooled over the Kawasaki H2 , Turbo out of the factory is insane . A nice walk around the fountains of youth .
Fint sted , men lidt lad betjening og ret dyrt . De tilbød dog gratis Shuttle bus hjem til vores hotel efter skydningen .
Not bad . Not great . Would go again because it ' s so close to home . Outdoor patio area very basic no frills .
The shakes were nothing to brag about . We stopped in here for a shake on a hot day . I am only giving the 3 stars because the prices are too high for what they offer .
Food tastes different after their 3 weeks break . Menu ' s changed . Miss their old menu ( or old owners ) : ( Pricey food doesn ' t reach quality .
Great food . Calm atmosphere . Lunch special prices are good but if you venture off the lunch specials you tab will go up considerably . Same with items from the bar . Overall I like place
The food was good ( the guacamole was divine ) , but the seat was so uncomfortable I had a hard time enjoying my meal .
This place is hit or miss , but I generally do not have a problem going here on weekends or after hours when my regular doctor is closed .
Excellent service and good food . I wish the cornbread was sweet though . All and all I say it was just OK .
Overpriced and sushi options are limited and small portions . Atmosphere is cool and fun so I guess you are overpaying for the entertainment . Cool idea nice spot but wish the sushi was better and bigger .
It ' s a decent local pub . Gets really busy on weekends . Although I ' ve never been here for a full meal , we always stop by for shots . Good vibe and friendly staff
Good choice for local Jazz , food and drink instead of going downtown to the usual places .
The wait staff were bitchy . Burger was good . Roasted chicken salad sucked . But the deep - fried BACON ( that ' s right ) was well worth the trip .
This was more like your old style casino hotel . Nothing spectacular but was fairly nostalgic . Not a whole lot to say since we only played a few slots .
I have found it inconsistent here . Sometimes great . Other times have encounteres screw ups . E . g . seizing sauces , slow service . Overall , worth trying though and a cool spot .
Not as many items for the lunch buffet to choose from compared to other places in Cleveland , although , the restaurant is spacious and the decor is classy .
I had the tuna tar tare and it was not that good they put a little bit of tuna and a gigantic amount of guac on it not to mention it was pretty tasteless
Not a big McDonalds fan , but their breakfast burritos are tasty , and have good deals on sodas , and good milk shakes .
Very average Thai restaurant . Solid lunch menu with lots of options that are all cheap . Quick service as well .
Very nice farmers market in a nice location . Not a ton of variety , but the basics were covered . Had breakfast and leone cafe and shopped . There was even some nice live music .
Good Caramel Shake and Eggs Benedict . Burger and Orange juice was just okay . Filled us up for the day
Good staff . The ice tea and iced coffee were very good . The spring rolls were lacking . Was there in the late lunch time and it was quiet . Not my cup of tea .
Kinda pricey for not a lot or high quality food . I do love their sweet tea and milkshakes tho ! !
Brunch copieux et bons burgers mais le service est trèèèèèèès lent . Maam Bolduc vaut quand même le détour pour son menu varié ( et très coloré qui pique les yeux ) .
Food is as usual but noticed that the machines on the outside in the sitting area didn ' t work and the ones on the inside are in desperate need of repair .
Not good , not bad . Average . The Wedding Cake cupcake is the way to go . Friendly counter help . They did not offer any information on any specials or loyalty club though .
My manicure looked really well but it ' s only the 4th day of a gel manicure and it ' s already peeling . Usually my gel manicures last for 2 weeks at least .
I expected more based off other reviews the service is good tight seating area I just was expecting more flavor from the fried bread taco it was basically a chulopa from Taco Bell my husband enjoyed the soup
the combos were very good and at a good price . i liked the food at woodlands a bit better but the atmosphere here was a little less take out then there . will be going back !
I used to love this place but they charge too much for a gel fill which why I ' m giving it 3 stars . . other than that , the place looks fancy and good customer service .
Basically a it ' s like subway , except instead of bread , they use a pita pocket . Good place to eat healthy , for relatively cheap .
Food was mediocre for bar food . Layout is also a bit weird with a lot of different seating room . Service was okay . May give them another try if I ' m in the area .
This place is inside the Hilton and is nice place to have a quick drink . The menu is very limited but the food is good .
Get the bone in filet and the Mac and cheese . The filet was s bit salty though . The sorbet dessert is pretty .
It ' s okay food . Nothing special . C7 is the only thing that I ' ve ever ordered there . Oh , and Won Ton soup .
This restaurant fits in Shadyside . The food was decent but overpriced .
The place has definitely improved since the parks department took over management . Not as much riff raff . Nice location in the marina next to the park . Volley ball courts just east of the restaurant
Nothing special here . Both my wife and I had the bacon and eggs . The eggs were a little over cooked and the toast was barley toasted . The home fries were good .
The tsoynami was okay , but brunch was definitely sub par especially for $ 10 . . . I had high expectations because of all of the positive reviews but felt underwhelmed and disappointed
Good margaritas , tacos were decent . But most of the other things we ordered were under seasoned
The lunch menu is a great value and provides a nice variety of Mexican dishes . The salsa tastes great , too
Have some issues but Brian is coming out to fix them this weekend . Hope all goes well .
Its not the ritz but go in knowing you will be full when you leave and you will leave pleased .
I adore the owner , and go there each time I ' m in town . I always get the zucchini pasta and the dessert Square with salted chocolate . I just wished they took American Express .
There should be 2 1 / 2 stars because the food was horrible and has not been so good the last few times I ' ve been there . Services good . place is clean and nice
I had the Fuku Burger . The sauce was quite tasty , but a little too much salt on the burger . The garlic fries were so - so ; not much difference from regular fries
The W is nice but the rooms are tiny and every time you open the patio door the AC turns off . The staff was ok . It ' s simply ok .
This place is ok . . I rather go to Ohana ! ! The white rice is too mushy . . . wasn ' t sure if spoiled or not ! !
This is a small Beer Store with limited selection compared to the larger branches . Service is friendly and there ' s lots of parking out front .
This place is adorable ! Delicious Thai Food made legit style . Walked in the middle of a work trip and got a delicious meal made to order . Oh yea .
Cute shop , old - timey , with many flavors to offer . Banana pudding shake was good and plentiful .
Flavored sake ? ! Who knew ! Cheap sake bombers and their sushi isn ' t too bad especially during happy hour . Puky , the bartender is real nice .
cute , good service , nice patio , bring lots of money
Friendly service , but very slow . The food that arrived did not look like the food we ordered from their menu .
I give it 3 stars because a - i used the atm outside and didn ' t get to experience the bulletproof teller windows inside b - there were no robberies while I was there .
My husband loves his French toast on the brioche bread . As a gluten free person , there wasn ' t as much for me to eat .
Always fun in the casino , the history of this place is so special it ' s hard not to have fun
Big breakfast portions , lunch and dinner sizes seemed smaller . Great crew . Table was prerty wobbly for a new open .
It ' s decent , but nothing to rave about . I ' ve been here twice and might try it again , but I wouldn ' t go out of your way .
Staff was very friendly . Food was soso . Something ' s are highly over priced and very bland . i may try breakfast but not at all impressed with the country fried steak
Now that Border ' s has closed they are really the only game in town . I buy most of my books online at Amazon but come here to browse and then buy my travel guides .
Good for pretty . . But not for healthy feet like skin removal or nail maintenance . Reuses files and wasn ' t sure equipment was clean . Staff friendly
A bit expensive to eat sandwichs . . . Place is good , service is good but too expensive .
Good food but over priced . Had the buffalo wings you get 8 in order and they are above average in size for . Hi ken wings .
What can I say . . . I like it . When friends are saying Ihop or even worse , Dennys ; thien this place is a Godsend for breakfast . Mimis is like Ihops VIP room .
Nice environment . Not great coffee . Small cold press coffee about $ 3 . 50 and left me wanting a Starbucks .
Mixed feelings . Nice atmosphere . Service friendly but slow . Poached salmon salad 11 $ about 3oz of salmon no taste . But 16 $ burger was delicious .
Comfy and quiet . But it would be great if they could offer free wi - fi .
Great food but horrible waitress . Very slow service . Waited 15 minutes just for water !
Great burger , poor service . Requested ketchup 2times and water at the beginning of meal and it came just in time in time for the last bite .
The noodles are great . I loved watching the staff prepare them . Very theatrical . All other elements of my dish were disappointing . Overall it was too greasy .
Expensive food . No service . Nice space . Decent food . I will wait to they figure it out before I return . Looking forward to breakfast I will admit .
A nice little hole in the wall Thai place . Need I say more ?
Pretty easy . Sold an old item . I know it was worth much more than they offered . But it ' s ok . Getting rid of old useless things are always nice .
Just another average gas station , nothing special . If you are looking for a last minute chrismas gift , this is not the place to stop .
Cheap and right down the street , but they don ' t take appointments . Ann is great for eyelashes though , the best in central Phoenix .
Cool looking place , but pricey drinks . Zucchini bread was delicious . Iced mocha was just okay .
Great food and drinks , but in the course of our dinner , we faced no fewer than ten up - sells . Take it easy . We can read the menu .
It has been many years since the last time I ate at any Lawry ' s and the food is still quite good . I couldn ' t have asked for better service - - very accommodating .
The food wasn ' t bad . It was a bit odd that they gave me plastic forks even though I was dining in . It wasn ' t busy either . . . .
Decent , better options in the area . . . a bit over priced . Food was average , drinks good but pricey and atmosphere was loud and distracting .
The ice cream and chocolate are both good separately but together the chocolate layer is WAY to thick and quite on the sweet side .
Not my favorite place . The veggie combo is very good but alot of their dishes under " vegetarian " are not so vegetarian friendly . . .
I ' ve had only the take - out , small portion and average taste for the price . Probably eat - in is fresher and better quality and portions .
Everything is just okay . Nothing surprise me or let me down . Probably , next time , I will try the fruit plates . Crêpe is too sweet .
For the choices that are available at this terminal . . . this is probably the best choice , but the fries were below average . The meat was tasty but didn ' t provide much .
3am carne asada fries ! Go mop up the booze that ' s flooding your digestive tract .
Great food , very very slow service ( took an hour to get entrees ) and a poor wine list . Unless you really know your Italian wines very poor selection for the California grape lovers .
It ' s a decent , quick pizza spot . Would order again , if I was in a bind . Otherwise , I would rather spend another 20 minutes in the car .
$ 20 lane fee if you use your own piece . $ 5 off if you check in with Yelp . Free targets .
When you want to grab something cheap and fast . . . . . their burritos are a good deal .
Great food , but never know when it ' s open . Really love to eat here but every time I get a big party group it ' s closed .
This is a perky , grab n go kind of place for Italian food . I liked the huge , chocolate chip cookies .
Food here is ok . I have had better though . I will not be coming back especially with all the bomb places to eat from in vegas .
Out of Blue Moon AND Stella . Cool music and good vibe , not pretentious like the W Rooftop Pool
Not bad steak , eggs & homefries ( real good ) . Rye toast . Water tastes like rust but had Oj / grapefruit mix . Typical diner .
This place is mediocre and should not have 4 stars . The food just wasn ' t that good . Just pretty average .
Very good ! Delightfully surprised and happy that there is a veggie pho option .
The beef tibs were a little dry but overall it hits the spot if you ' re craving Ethiopian food . The man who runs the place is very friendly .
Surprisingly decent . All the Grand Cafes have special late night menus with good deals on breakfast items like steak and eggs . Nice after a late night of drinking or gambling .
Pizza make for John Wang Need more cook put oven at home for cook Double double cook double Chicken no cook double Yung gweilo many many this no good
It was ok . I was expecting better based on the reviews . Had the cold noodles . Good for the price .
Good intentions . So close , but alas not quite good enough . The beef and pork are extremely salty , we couldn ' t eat it . Everything else is mostly premade and nothing special . Edible .
I needed a new tire and shopped around other places for prices . Everyone in town was charging the same amount . Not sure why these guys call themselves " Discount " Tire .
It is what it is , a McDonalds . You get what you expect . Inexpensive fast food . They do have a value menu . I do like the fries .
Got there 15 minutes before opening on a Monday . After opening it took about 30 minutes to finish up with 100 + people ahead of me . Seems like they did a pretty good job to me .
The braised fish with tofu was excellent ! Great clean dining atmosphere , nice & efficient staff . Will come back in the future to try their dimsum !
This place was on the Food Network , Mystery Diners . I think the show is fake . But , some of you folks have been here . Is that show fact or fiction .
Buffet Lunch Friday Dec 30 , 2016 $ 13 . 99 signature food : Chicken Tikka Masala , Butter Chicken , Mixed veg . Pakora , Goat Masala Dessert was Ok . only few selection .
very disappointed Mont blanc is gone Sur la table is gone I tried finding it but it no longer at the old location the only store I go there for is LUSH AND maybe California pizza
Fish chips are delicious . . Everything is deep fry . . It is cheap and interesting . . But the environment is not good . . People only can eat at outside .
Donuts are good . Place needs cleaning sometimes but aside from that , nothing too special . Just anouther Krispy Kreme doughnut place .
Basic Chinese food , good enough for lunch . Always hot food . Good service . Clean dining room . Parking leaves a little bit to be desired .
Easy access . Good snacks . Good cold keiths on tap . . .
First time , love the extensive menu . Turned off a little by the condiments on the table . . . crusty and dirty bottles . They need a good cleaning before refilling .
The ramen was good but not great . I ' ve definitely had better at other places . Probably wouldn ' t return to this location since I can get better ramen elsewhere .
Went for my birthday was happy with the short ribs I ordered , creative and trendy menu .
I did not really like the Dim Sum . I would try the regular Lunch menu . I would go back again .
I got the pastrami and added roast beef so yea that was awesome . The coleslaw and fries tied it all together . It was great sober I ' m confident it would be even better drunk !
Heather is cool and the wings were really good ( jerk or buffalo ) margarita was decent tasty . . . very clean . . nice selection of bourbons and whiskey . . . . def will return
Here for some Sunday football , food and drink . Lots of TV ' s . Food isn ' t really worth it . Drink prices pretty high .
I am not sure where all the stars and so many great reviews are coming from , but we were very disappointed . Service , food and cleanliness of the place far from even 3 stars .
Went there for a dinner . Nice place . Very colourful . The calamari was very tasty . Fish tacos and chicken tacos were just okay . Nothing special . Service was average .
1 . Quick place to grab a bite during lunch . 2 . decent service . 3 . decently clean place . Just OK
Havana Cafe Food : Nyah Atmosphere : Good Mojitos : Excellent !
Ramen was good and we also tried the fried chicken , tasty . We were there around 5 pm and they were not busy .
Have been here a few times . Decent reliable place . My favorite food - Mac and cheese with jerk chicken . It ' s good ! ! !
Very authentic French bakery . All the tables were dirty as well , just like France . Good pastries .
Sushi is good but skip their poké bol , sadly not many ingredients besides 3 / 4 of rice on the bol : /
3rd here and am still not sure if I really like it or not . Come here because it is walking distance to my home . Great service . Great atmosphere .
Hopefully just a off day last week . I ordered a roast beef sandwich and it was extremely tough . Still going to continue eating here just hope the quality control steps up a bit
This coffee joint had suce atmosphere . The only downfall is the limited space . Coffee was good . Definitely beats Tim Hortons
Not the 5 star experience I was anticipating . Good food . Fair atmosphere . Fair choices . Fair hospitality .
Food was good , service was absolutely amazing ! James was an enjoyable treat and an excellent waiter . He bantered and was responsive and knew what was great on the menu ! Thanks James ! !
Great service and good size portions . I wish they would make the bulgogi with shaved beef as it is a much better texture .
the best thing at archies are the petit fours ! they are a five star and worth the drive to the ghetto .
Bon et pas cher ! Excellent pour aller manger entre amis ( es ) au dîner où tard le soir .
At 10am yesterday they didn ' t have the egg tarts out . I came here for the egg tart . So got the other pastry instead . Price was reasonable and pastries taste good
The timeframe was misleading , but the work , not that it is done , looks very nice .
My favourite place in Markham for chicken , the spices and sauce are great . The garlic bread is not that great , the fries are ok , but it ' s all about the chicken really juicy
Solid bar food , darts and shuffle board . If they had some more big screens it would be a 4 star .
Decent curry soup . Tofu was great .
Great food & GF DF options but FYI the service has been terrible every time & keeps me from going back more often
A good show . A few slow moment . Great show for couples . Good way to fill an hour in afternoon . Look for by 1get 1 free coupons and they give you 2free shirts with coupon .
Updated review : still serving great wings . Patio has new tables and chairs . Summer 2016 special , 5 bottles of SOL For $ 25 !
The lady is super friendly and likeable . Will definitely visit the store again . Oh my sister tried their mango lassi , she loved it !
Decent food at Hard Rock Hotel . Margaritas are yummy . Tacos are good and portions are good though prices are high for Tex - Mex .
The fish and chips were excellent . Was very fairly priced and would go back when I am in town . Really want to try the Sunday Roast dinner .
This Pizza Hut location was recently renovated and looks spacious and attractive . Staff are very attentive and helpful .
Came here around noon and it wasn ' t busy . It has seating and the service is good . Everything is pretty much average at this place . Average tastes and average prices .
Quick , efficient . Not my favorite for the french fries . Too much oil on them . Staff friendly and fast to order .
Tastey , but chicken was a little dry . The red sauce was very good as were the carne tacos . Like they serve alcohol and beer .
Basically a freindly staff . Food was good . Drinks were average . They had no problem putting on whatever NFL game we wanted .
Food was ok , service was unfriendly and slow . Felt like they were doing us a big favor by allowing us to eat at their establishment .
Great place and Awesome pizza . 3 - 5 weekdays $ 5 pizza well worth the visit ! A bit pricy the rest of the week .
A nice place for lunch , reasonable prices , nice atmosphere , and good hospitality .
Although the Walgreens pharmacy itself is great and clean , the parking lot felt a little unsafe .
Nothing to write home about . Steak was decent but I ' ve had better . Our waitress didn ' t know the wine menu which was a bummer too .
The service is good the portions are huge . The food is very good . The banana pancakes and the corned beef skillet were delicious . I would go back again just for those dishes .
It gets the job done . Could it be better ? Definitely . Could it be worse ? Certainly . It wasn ' t too crowded , but the tubing lines were still a little long
Too trendy for me . Good food . Not great . Pricey and full of quality but I couldn ' t get on board with this place for some reason . I can ' t figure out why .
Decent but be prepared to wait over an hour . The ladies here will ignore you when you walk in and not sign you in even tho they see you . Poor customer service , not even friendly
Unique . Great food but kinda of a dive , strange service system . Must ask for English menue and help .
Tacos were okay , not very authentic . Flour tortillas ? WTF . Beer was good !
McDonalds it okay for burger sometimes , but it is not for all the times , because it is more expensive than other fast food like Burger King or In N Out !
Service : Average Food : Good variety on the menu , however 2 out of 3 orders had salt on the higher side Drinks : Good listing of wines and spirits Price : Decent for the location and type
Decent sushi . Some interesting Malaysian stuff on the menu . My friend got some coconut chicken dish that was pretty good . I got 3 rolls of sushi that was forgettable .
Just ok , not much of a selection , but it certainly beats Dunkin Donuts of India . Our order was wrong and the woman didn ' t speak any English , this is a Chinese owned donut shop
4 - stars for the epic Japanese poutines . - 1 star for the ugly decor . The pasta is alright too .
The food was decent but there were flies everywhere ! I had to keep swatting them away while I was trying to eat my chicken fajita pita .
They have a nice looking interior . Pretty decent drinks here . Our food , also okay . not much going on nearby . why is downtown so dead and empty ?
This is a beautiful butcher shop , with a great assortment of foods , packaged , canned and yes wonderful fresh fruits and meats . However be prepared to pay and pay big .
Pros : staff is really friendly and usually pretty helpful Cons : food is inconsistent is always very good in flavor but the quality and quantity depends on who ' s working
I guess it couldn ' t last forever , I gave a 5 star a few weeks ago . Last 2 trips chips were stale and smelled like rancid oil . I guess the honeymoon is over .
Famous Daves of Mexican in this location I ' ll pass all of my meal tasted like grocery store spice mix . They even offer mashed potatoes . Can you say Denny ' s of Tex Mex ?
The small block southern style burger was alright . The onion rings were terrible ( after two bites I had to throw out the appetizer ) . I would highly recommend changing the batter .
The wait really kills it . The food is so amazing and very reasonably price , but unless you ' re ready for a two + hour wait , it ' s not worth it .
Was disappointed to find some menu items missing . Overall , good meal ( TN Hot Fried Chicken ) . My wife did not like .
Not a bad airport at all . Pretty clean and easy to get around . Just not super exciting .
It is pricey and they take a looong time but my windows are always clear and the carpet spotless .
B - List . Good food and service . Other places do it better . Nice lights out front .
Not bad of a place to go grab a quick bite to eat . Better than mcdonalds they have a great selection of condiments you can put onto your burger and located right next to King Station .
Really got good service from the assistant store manager regarding bakery items . Store manager is very nice and really cares , he is working to approve the customer experience but it has a way to go .
Went here with friends for lunch . The cracklings rice soup is fun and yum to eat . The other dishes are classic so come over for whatever Chinese food cravings you have .
Food is excellent . Great neighborhood Thai food place ! Chicken cashew nut with hot spice is the best . Service not so good .
The service is slow and as you can see by the Salt and pepper shakers the employees don ' t take pride in what they do . Now for the food the burgers are fantastic . .
Food was fresh and really good . I loved the environment except it wasn ' t as clean as I would of hoped and the employees didn ' t greet us and wasn ' t Very welcoming
Cool little casino , part of the Flamingo , even tho I lost on craps .
Good dive bar but waitress was slow ( wasnt busy ) and wings were " eh " . Honey BBQ wingies were tasty and good beer specials keep me comin back .
Get there before 9 so you can enjoy the sushi revolving belt if not be prepared to pay full price for the rolls . Overall good sushi , a tad over priced , with a decent atmosphere
Pretty good , nothing memorable or especially good . Actually the free cup of soup when you check in on yelp or 4square was the best thing we had .
Way expensive but the wings are smoky and tasty . Service was impeccable . Fun atmosphere for hanging out with friends .
Great Seafood & Steakhouse in Kierland area in Scottsdale . My only criticism are tables are too close to each other if you want privacy . Dine @ Mastro instead @ North Scottsdale location instead .
What is there to say its Applebees . Food is generally reasonably priced but decent tasting at best . Its convenient for an easy bite . This location is clean and usually has pretty good service .
Nice location for Chatime . Average level of milk tea . The lack of staff makes every order takes a very long time .
This place is okay , the $ 18 steak was chewy and tough . The French dip was very boring . The calamari was good .
I came to this place this weekend to watch Raptors game . Wings were very big and delicious but nachos was horrible . The server was also rude and kept forgetting about our order .
loved the japanese cheesecake . a great selection for great prices . i don ' t recommend the deep fried taro or any of the deep fried round rolls . They are really thick balls of oil .
For some this is good food , but to me and my boyfriend it is subpar to other restaurants in Phoenix .
Dr Brian is no longer at this location . I don ' t know anything about the location now .
Mostly a take out and pick up place - no ambiance to speak of . Plenty of food , though I found my moo shu shrimp very salty . Beef and broccoli was good .
Not bad , but not impressive either . Too expensive unless you get the daily special . I ' ll stick to Maize next time .
I really liked the facial I got there , but I don ' t trust Dove products ( and other regular brands like that ) very much . I prefer organic facials , with all natural products .
This place is a great spot to chat catch up with the girls and eat yummy sweets . They ' re pricey but the decor and atmosphere makes up for it . Love the concept .
FYI , they automatically add 18 % gratuity to all bills during soft opening specials , supposedly to offset the cost of the opening special . Not cool .
Massive amounts of food for a decent price , but you have to like Hungarian food . The decor isn ' t spectacular , but the staff are reasonably kind and the food arrived quickly .
Just a FYI if when your ordering their sushi is not your normal size , more like mini sushi I was so disappointed after ordering to go . However , the waitress / hostess was nice .
Nice new way to eat noodles . I get mixed feelings of Japanese presentation , Korean spice , and Chinese flavour . Very interesting place .
In a shopping center . Moderate to small dining room . Expensive , Take Out was slow .
Food ok . Drink good . Ambiance Great . Line up for the Free Tequila Shots at the bar ! Family ambiance . But cool enough to stop by and party .
Food good . Service mediocre at best . . . 10 workers three customers and no greeting at all . . . Made me feel like I was bothering him . . .
Good spa on a budget . Very clean ! I had a body scrub and massage and left feeling very relaxed . Wish I was offered some champagne or they had fruit / snacks available however .
Not bad but also not the Bomb when we take it to go , I think all Chinese food taste better when you eat it there
Would recommend getting a michelada style beer , it ' s like a beer bloody mary .
If you ' re going to Vegas for the experience , then don ' t stay at the Hilton . However , if all you need is a clean place to rest your head , then it works .
Food was good . My server Bambi was at best perfunctory .
Just ordered from sushi time ! It was really fast , got here in no time . The sushi is not the best sushi I ever had , but for the price it ' s a - ok .
Atmosphere wasn ' t my thing . Dark and depressing but food was fairly good .
Had the curry poutine . Sauce and fries were spectacular , but the dish wasn ' t hot enough to melt the cheese curds adequately : ( Definitely overpriced , but worth the try .
Good food . Tough to get coffee refills . Busy Sunday morning brunch .
Nice casual atmosphere , friendly staff , tasty burger . Didn ' t leave an overwhelming impression , so it was average in my opinion .
Love their roasted potatoes as nice savoury meal . I ' m a fan of their fluffy donuts , try any kind and I ' m sure you ' ll love it .
The service was great . The food was average or below . Nothing great . It ' s a cool little place but I wish the sushi was better .
Great staff , service and price . The egg rolls were so so and the shrimp with garlic sauce ok . Not sure I ' ll be back .
The Coldstone portion of the restaurant is no longer there ! Sigh . One less reason to come here now . . . The coffee is still ok though .
Kid friendly . Like a combo sports pub and restaurant . Food is decent , but I prefer Winking Lizard ' s cuisine and atmosphere .
Pretty good but not the best . Our server tried hard to be helpful but they appeared to be understaffed . The " manager " came by and apologized without our complaining , it was a bit odd .
It was good . . tried hakka chicken noodles they made it slicy on my request . . taste was good but chicken was really hard to find . . wish i had taken a picture .
Cheap , convenient place to stock up if you are on your way to the Strip from the MacCarran rental car place .
Poor service . One elderly lady seats , serves and does everything . Good food though . Crepes were okay and well presented . Coffee was very weak . Place was clean .
Not many gluten free options for my friend . GREAT BEER .
Great little Jazz Cafe , only been here for drinks and the music . While I won ' t rush back , if I ' m in the area I might .
Not a bad place for dim sum . Have been here several times now . Most of the time it ' s been satisfactory .
Food wasn ' t bad . It def was slightly diff from the American Chinese food I am used to back home . Egg rolls were really good .
Food was good , had a grilled cheese sandwich , but a bit pricy . Not sure if I would go back again because of prices but it ' s a cute clean place to try
Quaint local spot . I want to like it but the food is just ok . Often hit or miss on the flavors . Nice owners but just ok food
Guys here are to busy fooling around with his friends and holding up the line but good food
Cool spot . . . too bad the owners and patronage know it . Maybe I chose a bad day and time but this place came off as a bit pretentious . good coffee though .
Outstanding filet mignon . Absolutely delicious Dover soul . The only thing we did not enjoy was the crab cake which was overfried and reminded me of a Mrs Paul ' s fishstick .
Prices were cheap but quality is sacrificed . The food was just meh for me . Portions are huge though so for a cheap and filling meal , go for it !
Service is just ok , food is just ok . Nothing really bad but nothing really special . Think a slightly upscale chain restaurant .
Soup was flavorful pork was dry and veggies were def not on the fresh side . Service was a little lacking . But overall was ok . Never came . Ask to fill water or tea .
The dragon berry mojito is delicious and so is the guacamole ! The enchiladas suck though - skip those
We order and take home every couple weeks . They give very large portions . Everything we ' ve tried has been pretty tasty . They are on the slow side so we usually call ahead .
This store has been closed for over a year . They moved to another place in Charlotte , close to Uptown . . . on Church St .
Good for a quick and easy meal . It ' s a lot like Chipotle . Although it ' s pretty good , I still think Chipotle is better . The service was great .
No jacket required . At least during the summer months . Found many people in shorts and t - shirts . I guess they relaxed the attire code . Good food and service .
Good karaoke host ( Ty Chidlow ) and decent prices . The good location ( right on the subway line ) keeps me coming back .
Yes . It ' s a chain restaurant and it ' s average . The service was fairly good and the cajun steak I ordered was definitely satisfactory .
Fairly average tacos and nothing special . The service was not very warm and the flavour was nothing spectacular . I guess it ' s inexpensive hence the high ratings
kissi rolls = thumbs up tacos = thumbs down kissi rolls were great ! tacos had gristle and even a chunk of bone in them - gross !
Good food , but not so great service . Very slow and often forget your bread and strawberry
Nice place . Good atmosphere . Pizza is really good ! ! ! ! Strongly recommend it . The lasagna was just ok . Little bland . Would go back for the pizza for sure .
Came BC I ' m a Hilton diamond member . Was offered the room to see there presentation . Its very modern yet kinda small studio . The suite is nice with a big jet tub . Center strip
Food is good , a bit too pricey though . Finding the door was a bit of a challenge but there are signs to help with that .
We were in Phoenix area and wanted to try different . We went there for dinner , for the price you are paying its just OK . There are other restaurants better than this one around the area .
I ' ll give 3 stars because the staff is friendly , however worst fish sandwich I ' ve ever had in my life . The chicken wings are very good . Don ' t go for fish !
I would give 4 stars for lunch and 2 stars for dinner . The lunch has better food in my opinion . The waiters and staff are friendly Dinner is overrated and pricey .
Pizza was just ok . Nothing exciting , except the price . We have tried them 3 times and have yet to be impressed .
I ' m giving them one star back for the great beef barley soup I ate on Wednesday . So full of meat and veg ! I still miss Leo , though .
The ice cream is good but the overpowering smell of urine is disgusting .
While we have had issues with our vehicle Jason has gone above and beyond to make things right . Some of the staff can be rude and condescending however he has been pleasant and helpful .
I went with friends after work , it has a pleasurable environment , their hummus , nachos were delicious , patio is nicer than inside on a nice summer day .
Grade : C Best if enjoyed after 11 : 30 pm on Friday or Saturday nights . Warning : do not try to recapture that enjoyment during the week !
The wait was crazy long for Sunday brunch . The food was tasty and once seated we were taken care of in an very attentive manner .
Food came out fast . Portions rather small . Food didn ' t have as much flavor as we expected . Place is small , intimate and packed on Friday night .
good Vietnamese restaurant . . . . not my favorite type , but wife and daughter love Pho .
They say restaurants & their names are the images of their owner - - just sayin ' . . . ps food not bad
Reuben was good , chopped lake salad was to . Reuben was good , chopped lake salad was to .
Since the change of ownership awhile ago it ' s gone downhill . Food is OK at best . I ' ll be finding a new sandwich place .
food was a lot better when they first reopened . if you want something good order stuffed banana peppers
Nice atmosphere , decent beer selection and ok food . I found the music here to loud for a bar where people come to chat . Average good local place . . .
Pretrygood service but the vegetables were really shitty . . . They should change their distributor .
My review is based solely on my visit , eating fajitas . The mild salsa was too hot but the big problem was that the steak for the fajitas was like eating bland beef jerky - very tough .
A decent hotel . Nice and clean and quiet . The layout is confusing though . It ' s hard to find the lobby .
Food was good , kind of pricey , service wad terrible . Person servingis did not do a very good job . Will not be back
I like that you can taste whatever zoup you want . Just ask !
Loved the restaurant , service and food . . . . . but absolutely too noisy to really enjoy the total experience .
Been here a few times and honestly it ' s been a 50 / 50call couple times it was very good and a couple times it has been very mediocre . Nvr has crab been out at times specified
Southern style fast food barbecue and burgers at a good price but served on styrofoam with plastic cutlery makes lots of waste
another ok mexican restaurant . . . nothing special We ordered the big enchilada plates where you try out a few different ones . . . not impressed Chips and salsa were good ! Probably wont go again .
Not bad . The only reliable restaurant we found inside this casino . Tried their veggie bowl , was super fresh & filling . Miso soup was average .
This place has improved a lot food tastes better and the quality has improved . . So updating my Rating . .
Okay casino remodeled rooms are nice . Great room rates .
Decent gas station . Wide lanes , convenience store , easy access . . . . what more can I ask for ? Return Factor - 75 %
Yummy but too experience . One ice cream with crepe or waffle was around 15 dollars include tax .
I had the London Fog which taste more milk than tea but other than that the place is a good place to study and hangout with friends .
Last time I was in this restaurant was when I was 14 ! Funny they did not change the décor at all ! Peking duck was OK - My fav in Toronto is still Asian Legend .
I have gone back a few times hoping to like their pizza but it is bland and lacks any distinct taste . They need to add more seasoning to their sauce and their dough .
Food was very bland and was okay . A lil pricy for the type of food . I would recommend going to another Mexican restaurant in town .
physical space of the club was cool but the men are creepy as shit and all our friends were touched at least 4 times
Nice decor , tried 2 beers , they tasted exactly the same and were just ok . I ' ll give it another try someday .
Service was good . Choices were wide and varied . But pricing was rather high compared to the average quality . Just wasn ' t wowed by the taste .
Standard late night . . . . . berto taco shop . Good place to kill a craving . 24 hours a day means you ' re always welcome .
I enjoyed my sushi rolls . Staff was friendly and the place is clean and nice inside .
Fast and greasy . Taste is OK but don ' t expect high quality , you will get full here .
Great selection of beer , but there was a weird smell in the building . Their happy hour is amazing !
Tried this place again . Food was great , cool concept , great vibe . . . . . . just made me very tired and sluggish when I came home . So be prepared for a nap !
Soo many choices to choose from ! La Boite Noire is the place to go for anything music and movies !
Pricey for KBBQ ( but then again , I ' m from LA ) . Service was very slow until they figured out I was also Korean . Food is decent .
What can u say about Swiss Chalet . It ' s decent , it ' s clean , it ' s consistent . 1 / 4 Chicken white with Fries . Always good .
Stayed here twice both times tv had major digital breakup ( unwatchable ) no casino attached which can be good or bad wifi sucks balls . Big balls .
Affordable . Access to the monorail . Great conference accommodations . Room service was expensive ( of course ) but fairly quick . Not bad . . . .
I like the coffee pretty much every time , and the Junction location is nice . Snacks are acceptable , not factory junk .
My first time here . They have good and friendly service . Tea is Ok . We enjoyed the Pad Thai we ordered . We will come back again .
great environment and music . service was also good . we ordered a soups and ramen , and they were good . the ramen i ordered was very korean , just like xin ramen .
3 . 5 stars . Hong Kong westernized style restaurant . They have a decent selection . Service is super quick .
Long wait decent care . . . over all not a bad place just bc it ' s close to home and convenient !
Solid choice that we stumbled across that was filled with locals which have us more confidence . The tacos pastor and hurache was delicious . Great find !
The food was nice , service was ok , price was fair . Overall a good experience but not ranking as one of my favourite Japanese places in Montreal . Has vegetarian options but not ramen .
Food is great but service for food and even drinks takes FOREVER make sure you have No plans the rest if the night when coming here as you will spend most time waiting for service .
Food very average . Service very average . Beer and Beer selection EXCELLENT . This place could be GREAT if the people that worked there were nicer and maybe smiled a little .
Crispy calamari is not crispy ; oily . Also the balsamic vinegar bread dip is missing the vinegar ; it ' s all oil . No tiramisu anymore ! Pasta and lamb chop is good though .
Expensive . . . just OK food , nothing special that makes it stand out from the crowd . Decor was nice though , which is what I did expect from a 5 star hotel .
Being a DD it ' s ridiculous to spend almost $ 10 on a small water . The staff was very rude and unhelpful .
Coronado Cafe : had a BLT sandwhich , no taste ! How do you screw up a BLT ? ? ? Casino Floor : soooo much waiting for a cocktail waitress ! Slot Machines : tight as Hell !
Food and service are good . Great staff . Restrooms however are consistently dirty - from the floors to the ceilings and walls - and everything in between .
The owner is an arrogant bastard , thankfully the wait staff and the food is much better than his attitude . I am surprised that he has stayed open that long with such a nasty mouth and attitude .
Quick , cheap , and good . I ' ve had better banh mi in the city but this place has good hours and a good location .
UPDATE : Finally , some better employees ! These guys know how to serve me right at night ! Definatley will come back again .
This is a fun place to hang out . I ' ve been here twice and had really good meals , especially the blueberry cobbler .
HATE Nothing . DISLIKE Kitchen closed before last call . LIKE Friendly staff . Open late . Menu is organized into helpful sections . Location is close to home . Selection of rolls . LOVE Nothing .
Went here after buying a Groupon . Never have had the pizza . Sandwiches are okay . It wil probably take coupons to get me back .
A bit pricey and , as noted in other reviews , not exactly overflowing with meat but the bread is very good and the sandwiches are satisfying ( if a little overpriced ) .
Pho was ok but not fantastic ! Noodles were hard and soup based too sweet for me . Waiter not very friendly but the place looks relatively clean .
Room was very nice . Whirlpool was green . . . kinda disappointing : / Nice staff though ! Love the sleep number bed - comfy !
The food was great . The portions are small . The prices are medium . The wine list is extensive . The atmosphere is outstanding .
Grade : C - Sub par food . Good service and decent prices . Think about it : Irish " cuisine " . Yuck .
Decent food . Large menu . Terrible hot and sour soup . I ' d rather eat at Spadina Gardens down the street , but this place will do late night .
Had dinner last night . We each had the chicken fajita a decent sized portion , unable to finish . Pleasant tasting ; nothing remarkable , but certainly ok .
Its ok . . . a little tired , slots work well ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Easy on sidewalk access
Sushi gets an A + . Everything else is sub - par . I recommend going on Wednesday nights when the sushi is half price !
Fajitas isn ' t a great Mexican restaurant but I think they do good fajitas . Its a good place for a group of people to share a bunch of food . I really like the shrimp fajitas .
Guacamole was not up to snuff this time . Virtually no tuna belly and the flavors were very off .
Decent beer selection . Pretty small place . You will probably end up leaving smelling like fried food as it ' s all right behind the bar
Smashburger is great place for a quick and delicious lunch ! Plenty of great choices to choose from or basically a build your own burger option too ! Friendly staff ! Clean restaurant !
They changed management and now its just ok Chinese .
Great place for inexpensive decoration . Quickly pick up ornaments for a fraction of other retail places . Anything that you ' ll plan to use often , get it elsewhere .
One of the better thai food place in las vegas , super fast and friendly service , food taste just right . Serving is on the small side and pricey for a thai reataurant .
Just transfered my rx here so far ok , dont like their phone system though .
Wish they had more larger sizes and bigger shoes but all in all it was nice . The prices a bit high for used clothes but you can find a bargain if you have the time to look
I stop in when I need some delicious broth with warmth and spice . The decor is interesting and the service is quick . I have always enjoyed the pho and the grilled shrimp dish .
Tacos were good , regret getting various topping that didn ' t mix well . Cilantro weren ' t my favorite . Place has nice art work , very crowded .
OK place to go . Good range of music . Nice outdoor area where you can still feel the AC . Prices really suck .
les dim sum sont bons mais il y a beaucoup trop de glumatamate dans les plats . pour un restaurant classé numéro1 pour les dimsum , je suis décu . j ' en ai connu meilleur
ah , yes , another trendy yet overrated place to munch . that being said : yum , but mostly yum @ their cheese fries
Great food . Very straightforward and good for groups and families . Plus I ' m always down to support the Red Rocker .
Only reason I ' m giving it a 3 is , because I get ride on this ride . I mean it ' s cool that u sit on a " motorcycle type car "
Thick crust , fresh toppings , great service ! Delicious spinach salad , but super fatty and gross buffalo wings .
Walked in on a Saturday looking for a good cup of coffee . The staff was really sweet & the coffee was pretty good .
Ordered Penne Rigate . Was completely underwhelmed . Not at all spicy or garlicy . Sauce was way too oily . Was really looking forward to a delicious pasta but was not satisfied at the end .
Convince location . The food is good but a bit salty for me . Lobster Mary is something different and worth a try .
Did not live up to my expectations ! Jackpot roll was highly recommended and supposedly their best roll , but it tasted like a basic roll . If u want real sushi , head down to SD : )
Not bad , service was ok , food came out fast . Was quite empty for a Saturday afternoon .
Been going here for years . Avoid busy times for take out . Takes longer than quoted . Once my pizza was undercooked . Ugh .
Quaint place with cozy decor and good Israeli food . Dooby is usually around to chat with and with belly dancing some nights it makes for a good experience .
The food was good , but we got a piece of plastic in our potatoes . They were very accommodating , but you just don ' t expect that to happen at a place like this .
Dinner here was just ok . . . . service was outstanding , appetizer was delicious ( Quesadillas ) However for the main course I had the 22 0z steak , wasn ' t impressed it was boring .
The food was good but it had very limited options and the place was quite small where a table that fits 6 people was shared with three customers . But the service was kind and the price is good
It has been a year since my visit so I will say you should check the place out for yourself . Good Luck with the business JK .
Nice casino away from the strip with lots to do from bowling to bingo and a theater to catch a movie . Rooms are nice and clean so I would let mind staying here again .
The food was good . Nothing out of the ordinary . Nice place . Nice children ' s menu . They also have cocktails on the menu , but I did not try any .
The place trys harder than the rest when it comes to beer selection , some very wide ranging brews across the library of beer . Also the cajin burger was very good .
CVS is a CVS is a CVS . You do what you do and I love you for it . I will visit you when you ' re convenient . Thank you .
Une bonne poutine salé nommé " chili cheese fries " , place kosher , ambiance agreable , un peu pricey mais ouvert tard , petite terrasse disponible .
We ate duck in steamed bun and duck . the crispy skin was a good combo with the bun . The duck tasted good .
Nice staff , friendly . But , I totally hate bugs and there was a spider crawling by my seat . Maybe they need to mop more .
Definitely a nice break from the strip and our server was very sweet .
This is probably my favorite please to go this far . . the food is super tasty and hits all the right taste buds in my mouth . . delicious
Okay except everything is spread out all over the place hard to find what your looking for and very expensive
Good for when you are craving grass jelly desserts . I liked the grass jelly latte , pretty good . Not like WOW ! Will go again though
Love this place ! Food is great , service has improved recently . The thai curries and sushi are highly recommended .
it was just good but there was something missing the bar tender only came over one time to check on us I would go back
It ' s pretty inside . Not enough good restaurants inside to eat in . If it ' s raining this is a good place to check out . Hard Rock Cafe is moving out Ina few days .
Our last experience here was not good . Cold food , waitress was unattentive . manager was nice and apologetic and addressed our issue . Will review again after our next trip .
Trying for the first time bowlology the acai bowl was OK and the service was OK if you want good Bowls you need to go to vitality bowl way better
The food gets no complaints from me . When you can end up spending more there than in an overpriced San Francisco - Chinatown restaurant , something is really wrong !
No major complaints here . Food was pretty good and the employees were very nice . Could be cheaper though . . .
Small cafe on ground floor of health food store . Order at counter and food brought by server . Very limited menu good food small portions . Very casual . Have wifi so you can hang out
The chicken was great ! Good portions for a decent price . Would go back for the chicken !
Wasn ' t so thrilled with the quality of food . Bread stale and food average . Hyped up because of the Venetian .
I needed to drop off a printer cartridge to be recycled . The staff were friendly and there was no hassle in dropping off the pre - paid package .
The food was great , service was terrible , and the place was kinda dirty . I wish they had a better staff for such great food .
Quality food and unique concept . First time in my life the last bite of my filet was just as warm as the first ! Resist the urge to touch the stone .
Great number of TV ' s for sports watching . Not a bad place . Food doesn ' t really stand out , but some good items worth a gander , Philly steak and cheese egg rolls ! .
Ok service - very expensive even for an airport restaurant . Chips and guacamole pretty average . Chicken Cesar salad nothing special .
Great place to party , we are glad to have you downtown . I would have never found you until the MMA of LV had their party inside .
I had the pho here last Saturday and the noodles were cooked too long , and were mushy . The Vermicelli with pork was decent . We got 10 % off for showing our california Drivers license .
1 star taken off for promising a complimentary print on our last day of class but never fulfilling that promise .
Gotta get the hair right for Miami ! Cheap , usually quick and some hot women cutting hair
It is not the best or newest , but their pool is , they have the best pool ever in Vegas .
Slow . Only one employee , 3 of us stood around too long . Interior is nice enough . average coffee shop , strong flat white .
Nice atmosphere and very nice place . Food was good , took a little longer then we were expecting for just burgers . Kids mac and cheese wasn ' t very good , to gourmet for our little ones
Very greasy and only a small bit above the standard fare .
Food was average at best . Very rude old lady working that day . Maybe I didn ' t get the right dish . Was kind of pricey for what you get .
If you ' re talking pho you ' re speaking my language . VIETNAMESE MEDICINE . Something secret in the broth that is so so magical . Extremely fresh and they have a full bar
The food volume is a lot for the pho , which is pretty sweet . Nothing impressive though . I tried a lot of their dishes , and none of them caught my attention .
The food is always fresh , always given to you in a timely fashion . Very nice people , they just nickel and dime you for everything , ugh , it gets old .
Not bad for an all - you - can - eat . Reasonably priced . Good service . Great hole in the wall joint .
Trump hotel is okay we have a decent view of Vegas from the 50th floor , but their pool area is not the best .
Food is very inconsistent sometimes it ' s great and other times it can be really bad . I keep giving them another chance . Hopefully it gets better and more consistent .
Les oeufs mimosas étaient juste des oeufs mayo . . . Mon tartare de boeuf était bon mais mais il manquait un petit quelque chose .
The splash pad was very busy . Tho it was nice to have the pad shaded and close to various aged playgrounds . The restrooms were close too .
It is amazing New style of fresh made udon Restaurant cafe in Vegas , many of competitors at Spring Mountain , need some more improvement , I ll be back
Idk , maybe it eas an off day . The waffles werent as good as i remember . The chicken was above avg but the waffles seriously disappointed Truffles fries are a must .
The ambiance was really cute but I didn ' t love their food . However the servers were sweet and the presentation was great
The food is great the beer is wonderful but the Mexican waitress with a bad attitude killed the positive vibe .
The timeframe was misleading , but the work , now that it is finished , looks very nice .
Nice place , friendly service had the chicken and waffle with a side of scrambled eggs . Eggs were a bit over cooked , the chicken had a good flavor and the waffles were so lite and fluffy
Cool atmosphere , good service , good filet , shrimp sucked . Didn ' t live up to the hype for me , but I ' d give it another go .
Pretty good dim sum . Good service . Good food . Gets really packed on the weekend .
Its a really nice place the food ain ' t that good aint that bad either its like a 7 out of 10
You have to at least go in and order an overprice meal just to see the place inside . Stay away from the nachos unless you like soggy greasy ones . Food is pricey .
OK selection and pricing at best . They lack the variety and qty of food items including organic a Super Wal - Mart has and their prices are higher .
average Mexican food . Better than some , not as good as others .
Was excited to eat @ Fellini ' s . Was highly recommended . Service was spot on , friendly . My braciole meal was ok , a bit too salty for my taste . I still recommend .
Good , but not excellent like Tao or ( as a less close comp ) extraordinary like Nobu .
A bit of a hodge podge the day that I went for brunch Good quality food but cheap kind of vibe Sort of like a " trying too hard " greasy spoon
This is a great little seafood place . Usually doesn ' t have a wait and very family friendly . I order the broiled Tilapia . Pretty tasty ! !
Last experience was vastly improved . Back on my list of places to go . Service was better , which was the main issues they had in the past . Buffalo blue bites are the go to .
Typical cafe . The biscuits and gravy were ok . Nothing special . I was hoping for better food with such high reviews . The service was excellent . Fast and friendly .
Food was great but small portion and pretty pricey . Feels like an upscale / corporate environment . Our server was very nice and did a good job .
Bland food service was OK left hungry I know I sound like I ' m complaining but place felt stuffy and staff acted like they were doing us a favor .
The bone - in wings were dry , I won ' t order those again . Boneless were much better and a decent size .
The grooming service can take quite a few hours but always friendly service and happy with the end results .
I had a decent time at the bar . Service was good , food was on par with any other Red Lobster .
I like that this place plays good music and the actual music videos . Drinks were okay ( though pricey ) but the dance floor was too small .
A few friends and I got 3 different orders so I tasted them all . I wasn ' t impressed by any of it . Personal preference I guess . Staff was nice though .
Once had a live lobster so like I mean I guess you could say that I am a pretty big pork Jerk chicken can you know so like yeah please eat here great food like reaaaaaaaal good
Authentic Chinese , great food . I loved the tea that they served - - it helped with the spice . However , service was not up to par .
Good food , but the service was SOOOO slow . Don ' t go in here if you have a quick lunch break . They aren ' t fast enough for that !
Enjoyed the cold corn soup . Very good . Also loved the tomato sandwich . Enjoyed an outside table in a Cleveland hot - spot .
At Jen Bush Forum with MaMaw . Surprisingly no security at all . Full house standing room only .
SOOOOOOOOO Expensive ! ! ! ! Great Views of the Strip but it was Cold . . . No Heaters around at all . .
Atmosphere is cool . Fish tacos are fresh but missing something in the taste . Steak tacos were better . Make reservations . I would go back but not hurry back .
Guacamole is perfection ! Nice wait staff and creative menu . Music was a little loud for a seated dinner , but patio and bar area are great for drinks after work or on the weekends .
This place is fine if you want to wait an hour to get work done . Even with an appointment I ended up waiting 45 minutes to even start my service . Definitely no sense of urgency .
Oops posted wrong review for this Ross . It was a different location .
Suggestion : Dim the lighting a bit and offer larger beer selection . The lady singing is very soothing .
They used to be really good and the price made it better , but lately not so much . Last Pedi lasted 2 days . Thankfully I found a new place .
Food is good but I ' m not a fan of standing in line to order my lunch . Have only been there twice and had their bang bang burger which is pretty good .
Really nice staff , but cut my heels until they bled during the pedicure , and the nail polish bubbled on my manicure .
Its a bowling alley . Don ' t order the nachos they will be soggy . $ 2 per game and $ 2 shoe rental on Tuesday .
Got the organica drink . It tastes better than it looks . I thought it would taste better if they could add more pineapple in my drink .
Overpriced . Not nearly as good as I would ' ve expected , given the price . We will not be ordering again .
Its Swiss chalet . . does it need a review ?
Good steaks n a nice comfortable restaurant to sit in . . Has a good assortment of beer ' s . .
Food very good , cool design . But , the place echoes loud , music to loud and its super hard to have a conversation with people your dining with . Major flaw in this cement box .
Nice place with good food , but it ' s a little pricey . We recommend RA or Sakana if you ' re looking for good sushi in the Ahwatukee area .
Claes Oldenburg ' s Free Stamp Mega Size Sculptures for everyday life thing Free to take photos Free for all Or as Claes said Freedom got stamped or pressed down hard ?
The baked Italian sandwich was basically a hot pocket in quality except my crust was burnt . Decent but not worth the price . Great service though .
I enjoyed the vegetarian pho . I didn ' t love sitting at the community table but it was an experience . Great service !
Good food but pricey for Mexican food . Cantina gave me a free dessert for this review though so that was nice . Will be back .
Working with them
Got room comped . . was really impressed with the room . . internet didn ' t want 2 work . . solid choice if on a budget . . I would come back again
Nice selection of plants , staff a little standoffish . I had a bunch of questions and picked up a few flowers .
Les nouilles sont fraîches faites sur place / / / Noodles are fresh made here !
The service was slow even thou it ' s kinda empty and the food took waaaaaayyyyy too long to get here . It ' s okay in flavor at best .
Great place to gamble . Good location . But wierd vibe sometimes : - (
The chicken here was good but nothing out of the ordinary . After hearing so many rave reviews I set my hopes up high . I probably won ' t come here again .
Steak fajitas were dry and bland , beans were really good . Great ambiance and service . Husband really liked the ribye and pork enchiladas .
If you are looking for a close quarters comfort food breakfast then go here . Food was okay , people were friendly . The price is right for food quality . . .
food ok , service was good . . beer was cold . pool tables were good . enjoyed the night with my son .
Dior beauty is different than other Dior . You can ' t return any unopened new items . And you can only exchange at this specific location not at all the other Dior .
Solid food with traditional breakfast menu . Nice outdoor patio , fresh decor and very pleasant servers .
It ' s a great alternative to Starbucks . I love their coffee and they serve good pastries as well .
Nice ambiance and friendly waitress and staff but food could be better . The only thing I really enjoyed was the pork belly bun .
Decent sandwich . Reminds me a bit of JJ ' s but not as fast . We walked over one night since we stayed at the hotel next door . It was so convenient .
Vegan pizza is yum . This place is inconsistent . Except for the attitude . That ' s consistent .
Good , cheap , and very quick food in the Oakland area . Cheaper and quicker than lulus , but quality is a little less than lulus .
I always have fun when I ' m at Blue Moon . Whether it ' s to stop in for a quick drink after work or to see friends performing . Drink prices are average .
Pretty good doughnuts . Nothing good or bad to say about this place . Doughnuts are middle of the road , I ' ve always had pretty good service .
Great environment and classy restaurant . Service was good . Food quality is okay , could be better for the price . Staff were all friendly and helpful .
It was okay , I definitely miss it . The valley needs a few real Italian delis . This one was close . ish .
When they eventually got the NO cheese part of our order right the food was great . loses two stars because it took 3 attempts to explain no cheese in our burger please .
Decent food , decent vibe , located in the hard rock hotel . A nice solid spot for visit . I got their pink taco was pretty good . Would come back again .
Good service and nice decor . Ribeye steak was great but the lobster tacos appetizer was disappointing and over priced . Three 2 inch tacos for $ 21 . 00 ! Stick to the beef at this restaurant .
r . i . p .
No more all you can eat sushi ! ! Food is ok , but that was their big selling point for me . Probably won ' t be going back .
Cheap rooms Low minimum bets if you gamble 24 hour bowling alley Movie theater Crowd isn ' t the best Decently far from the strip . Sandwich shop is delicious
It ' s fine . . . nothing special . For some reason my brethren from the Valley of the Sun were huge fans , don ' t get it , won ' t be back .
Went for lunch . Food was pretty good , not extraordinary . Service was okay , not exceptional . Ambiance was okay . Everything was fine , just not beyond the norm .
Speed breakfast . It ' s breakfast and you can ' t go wrong . Free refills on coffee and tea .
Dim Sum ! The food comes out fast , service is always friendly , the place is big and they have all the stuff that I like . Come late on the weekend and be prepared to wait .
Nice patio and atmosphere , but food is mediocre at best . Too many other good breakfast places out there like JJ ' s and Soul .
floor was dirty , service a little slow
Everything was delish but on the pricey side . Tried the BBQ platter , grilled salmon , sweet potato fries , garlic fries , chicken strips and beat salad
Tried the Atkins plate , corned beef , cottage cheese . The beef was good . Fine Deli cottage cheese . A bit expensive .
Pizza here is decent but a bit overpriced . And counter service has sucked sometimes . They do have good lunch specials . I tried a slice of their white pizza for lunch and it was really yummy .
Pratique ce grand centre commercial Un peu de tout
I pass by this walgreens on the way home so I stop in frequently . Always able to find what I need . Clean and organized , will come again .
Good food , a friendly young lady helping me with my order made for a nice experience . When I ' m Westmount I ' ll definitely eat there again .
Good gyro . Got the lamb gyro wrap . Service pretty good too . Hot sauce isn ' t very spicy per se , but definitely tasty . Would recommend you add it onto your dish
Food was good but fries were barely warm . Server was good , and friendly .
Slow as hell and the food spilled all over my car which pissed me off even more . I ' ll never do curb side them ever again .
The food was very average . Nothing special . Chicken breast was very dry and the smoked pork sandwich had a lot of fat chunks in it . Live music and fun dancing to watch .
I was sick and really wanted some soup so I tried this place and it was ok .
Average food with average service . I came here for lunch and was disappointed they didn ' t have sashimi . Otherwise , it ' s very spacious and lots of parking .
Food was great ! Service was " standard " . Had to ask for bread 3 times , but the quality of the food made up for the service ! Might bring wifey back .
Food was delicious and drink good , but we couldn ' t have a conversation because the music was too loud .
Spinach dip is deliciously not good for you !
Good carne asada tacos . Don ' t get the " combo " unless you want a soda . They give you a small scoop of beans and 5 chips . Just get the tacos by itself .
I really liked the tacos , but the price is a bit steep considering the amount of food you get . Especially considering that for the same price you can get a lot of good food in Chinatown .
One word ; disappointing . There are better mexican restaurants in the neighborhood with a more cozy ambiance .
Service with a smile . Friendly staff . Place is a tad on the smaller side but same creamy cold stone ice cream as every other location . No surprises .
Spicy salmon roll was best I have ever had . The service was extremely slow and she forgot a few things . Prices are decent . If you have an extended lunch hour , check them out .
A nice lounge . . . not worth the cover , however . It ' s an intimate space , but very overpriced .
I don ' t think it deserves the best of Phoenix but it was ok . Drinks are tasty , bartender was Nice . Server quite strange .
The hair cut was good but $ 80 for a men ' s haircut is ludicrous . For that price it ' d have to be a fantastic cut , which it was not . Not recommended .
It ' s okay if you like Main Street beer . . . if you want creative . . not your place . . . staff seems more interested in single patrons . . pretzels are terrible
Their chicken tender is really good with source put aside . Wings need to be more well done , and you always want to take out caz their table are kind of dirty .
Not bad food but not for me . Too one dimensional unless all you really want is average chicken in a tortilla .
I love it ! I ' ve tried a lot of the che ' s they have on the menu and haven ' t been disappointed . Could be a bit sweet .
Good pan cakes good potatoes good bacon cleaner than Denny ' s slow service bad hash browns good coffee
This store is like a Whole Foods Market but with a mom and pop vibe . Staff was very friendly and helpful . Great place .
There is a new massage , yoga and acupuncture studio . The new business is called The Institute for Human Potential . http : / / email . mindbodyonline . com
About as close as you can get to Montréal smoked meat in this city . Price is right and the portion is huge !
Went here for restaurant week in Cleveland . The portions were substantial and filling . I got the stewed meat dish and it was pretty good . The dessert was really but too rich .
Got a slice from the outside stand that was barely edible because it was so cold . Keep walking to find a hot slice !
Good food but the service is a little shabby .
A very good place in terms of quality vs prices . Nice setup and quick service . However , the waitresses could use some training to make you feel a bit more welcome .
God food and great service but the price is high . We could eat at a sit down service place for the same price
Typical bar food but pretty good . Good beer selection
Good service but the last 2 times we ' ve gone there have been hairs in my son ' s kids meal . . A bit disappointing .
I give it a 3 . 5 . Great location , friendly staff , cheap , and much better than the others in its class . Will go back .
It used to be better . Some food didn ' t taste the same anymore . Wait time for food was quite long . However , food selection was good . lunch AYCE is really worth it !
Above average Chinese buffet . Food is generally hot and tasty . Selection is more limited than most , though .
Lots of beer options . Enjoyed the live bands and food . On the weekend the place get a bit busy . Definitely a spot for girls night out .
Medium steak was a little too well done . Good portions though .
Descent selection of cigars nothing special or hard to find cigars , pretty over priced . Good ambience too hang out and enjoy a cigar and watch the game
Great place for a drink , good service , but the food is not great . They ' re trying to be an upscale pub without the quality that should come with the price tag .
This location was pretty busy when I went on a Friday morning . There are no comfortable seats to sit and relax , read or work . All wooden chairs .
I do like the drink but why it taste differently every time ! ! ! Sometimes it ' s sweet but sometimes not really depend on luck
It was fresh and yummy but many things need to be order ' A la carte ' i think they need only all you can eat menu . That makes my feel not good .
Older motel but nice roomy room and bath with separate vanity , wash basin . Wi Fi not working , amenities like hair dryer not there . Reasonable rate tho it was November .
Authentic Mexican as they come in the valley . I ' ve been coming here for the last couple of years when I want to get my fix of authentic .
Food per se was okay but too overpriced , particularly its salad main course for lunch . The servers were very friendly .
This used to be Arcadia Family Clinic . Turning into Honor Health seems to have broadened their ability to care for patients . Other than that , see my review of Arcadia Family Clinic .
Not a bad visit overall . . . the customer service could have been better . . . but overall good !

Can never go wrong with pizza flatbread pepperoni pastrami gotta love it when you ' re drunk
I had the chicken baguette it was delicious nice and fresh ! I want to try the beef next time
I gave 3 due to the extremely nice staff and great enviroment . But i wasnt to thrilled about the food . I ordered the stuffed shells and the fried oysters . I wont be ordering that again .
Good , not great food . Certainly didn ' t live up to the hype or price .
The price is not cheap & food is ok nothing extraordinary ! I ordered lengua burrito no sour cream & guacamole included n small chicken taco
Decent food , pretty good service , my only real complaint is my dislike of the new ziosk systems on all the tables ( otherwise I would have given 4 stars ) .
A good brunch and a pleasant dining experience with solid service . The ambience was nice , and I was surprised to see the number of children and larger groups coming in for brunch .
Food was pretty good . Chicken tikka masala was extra good . However , service was not that great . Not bad , but it could be better . A little slow .
1 free penny margarita with check in with Yelp is pretty awesome , but the free drink was not enough for some in the group to gloss over the somewhat pricey options and mediocre food .
Great selections . Employees were nice except for one woman with dyed blonde hair , she ' s mean and inconsiderate ! You know who you are and what you did
Planes take off and land here bringing people from far and wide to CLE . The recent updates to the terminals were much needed , and make it feel like it belongs in the 2000 ' s .
Food was great . Waiter was great . For got my to go box and was left outside looking like a dumb ass but im sure they have their reasons
Went there for brunch one time . Food is ok and a bit pricy too . May not go back any time soon . . .
Food is overpriced for the kind of quality and taste you get . But it ' s a cool place to hang out with friends and has great Bellinis .
Only went there to buy a couch set and washer set becasue of their blk friday deal . other than that nothing special .
Sushi is too expensive and isn ' t as good as others around the area . Habachi is hit or miss depending on your chef .
呢间算系bath and body works outlet吧，每次逛完winners都会顺便行埋呢度。虽然话系迷你outlet , 但新货一样有。旧货减价都会有不同时候减价多d或少d。相对系商场内的bath & body呢度比较人少去逛，所以点知试点样选都可以随意d
The sandwiches are fantastic , but the service can be hit or miss and the place is very packed a lot of the time .
Not bad . But not great . Buy one get one free sushi would be the only reason I would go . Service is suspect too
Overpriced coffee without the free upgrade at checkin - - - and the staff made everyone in my party feel uncomfortable . We drank our drinks outside .
Kind of a whole in the wall bar , but pretty big place and overall clean and pretty neat place . Lots of Tvs so you wont miss any of the games . Very nice draft selection .
Ribs are good ! The artichoke however had no meat and the sweet potato fries were soggy . I ' d go back to try other things , but had an ok overall experience with the food .
Ribs we ' re fall off the bone yummy ! My steamed veggies were cold which is a turn off . Service was good and food came quickly . Next time I ' ll get the fries instead .
The pizzas have always came out ok . But any orders for their bread of any kind , brown as hell . It ' s too burnt for my liking . Never ordering them again .
They do their own blood work and have an onsite digital x ray machine . Subtract 1 star for charging people to do fmla paperwork , subtract 1 star for less then friendly staff .
Happy hour is decent . . . atmosphere wild looking service average food did not tried any
What we ordered was good but I expected more food options . Our waiter wasn ' t attentive at all . Another waitress saw that we needed drinks and brought them to us .
Food is always good , as is the service . BYOB makes it reasonable , as well .
Average souvenir shop . Good air conditioning . Typically hi prices . Most of the things you can get here you can probably get elsewhere
Not bad , but it ' s more fast food than Persian restaurant . Still good for the low wait time and decent kabob .
Bought some donuts But they were not fresh The abeyance was ok Heard that they make fresh nd hot donuts every thursday . . have to try them on one thursday
Location is absolutely fantastic ! Convenient transportation . However , it ' s a bit noisy during night and the double bed is smaller than my expectation . Regard to its location , still recommended !
Great food but service was very sub - par . Almost always had to ask for our waiter ( Jonathan ) who seemed very uninterested in his job and was extremely awkward , which made us very uncomfortable .
Stopped in for a cake . Lots of premade to choose from . The young lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful . I felt though they should have had more than one person working .
Steak chain , that ' s about it . Look for the chain to be renamed or sold within 3 years . Nothing special and loud . Better steak than the Keg however and better prices
The menu is limited and the service spotty . . . but they have a great outdoor setting to hang out around and drink beer with friends .
Food was good but service was terrible . Our server didn ' t do anything besides take our orders , and the place was empty ! Not at all the service that we had expected .
Bonne musique , repas convenable et prix raisonnable . Le service à la clientèle est normale .
Pretty good but you ' re better off driving another half mile south to Thai E San . Food lacks flavor depth big time .
Luxurious atmosphere , however breakfast choices are limited and service not great . Would benefit from having daily menu specials . . .
Request Jason ! ! ! ! ! ! He is the best Dinner was fantastic , ambiance nice and cozy . . . . TV screens everywhere ! Luv it
The service was pretty slow , but the waitress was nice about it . The food was decent and about as much as I expected .
Tasty food , fun place to go for an off - the - wall / goofy vibe . There is always something to look at . Either what movie is on or what costumes the staff is wearing .
Came in for the first time with my friends . Sat at the bar with Tiffany and had lunch . Food and service were great .
It ' s a nice Holiday Inn with a friendly staff . The location is good : eat at the nearby Melt for delicious grilled cheese . The staff is very gay friendly too .
Very overpriced . Drinks were overrated . The food was chewy and had no flavor . I was very disappointed .
The pastrami Ruben was pretty good especially with tater tots . The beer was slow getting to the table and they could use more craft beers on tap .
Delivered on time . The office that I bought it for seemed to like it . I had to do delivery on line , they couldn ' t do it over the phone which was bizarre .
Although their menu is delicious , their prices are barely worth it . Used as a treat now and then , but $ 6 for a small bowl of soup isn ' t very practical to me .
Mind blowing food , mind numbing service and unreasonable wait times . Is it worth it ? You decide .
Decent coffee , decent atmosphere . Very difficult to find parking . Wanted to try here for awhile , was underwhelmed .
All the staff are well trained in their jobs , not the friendliest but they do the job . Big store , lots of selections . Can ' t complain . . .
Pretty decent burrito , but nothing special . Portions are smaller and more expensive than other better burrito places so I ' d return only if I ' m in the area .
Las Vegas location . Food was good ! Atmosphere was not conducive to a good meal . Service was sub par and music was WAY too loud .
Would be better if they used chicken thighs . Doesnt compare to Sarku Japan . . . a little bland compared to what we are used to . . .
Great hotel . . highly recommend . . rooms are good size . . view from here is excellent ! Would definitely recommend to friends !
Not bad for casual and quick . Had calzone kinda pricy and small portions . But not bad
It was OK , I needed a Chinese food fix
. . . waiter said there were no spoons ; stirred my coffee with a butter knife . Also , didn ' t order the soup . . . because , you know , no spoons . . .
Generals tasted vinegar like . . . still trying to find a back east style generals chicken
This is not my first choice of restaurants for breakfast but I went again recently and had the Eggs Maximillian and they were very yummy . A bit overpriced for breakfast but still good .
Too expensive and the food not that flavourful . Not the best experience . The waitress was super nice and helpful However there was nothing special about the meal . Also the portions Were really tiny
If you ' re looking for low budget pizza meal , this is the way to go ! Love their original crust , and fresh veggies . Phone order was quick and easy . Delivery was prompt .
Fun place . Food was okay . It ' s all about the show .
Had no problems with the machines ! Cheap , efficient , and overall decent coin laundry joint .
A terrific product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Lines can be long ! VERY PRICEY !
Their signature Jalapeño Bacon burger is the thing to get here . It really is good . The rest of the menu was fairly average .
Food was delicious but a bit pricey . Was excited for the dancing part of the experience but I guess Monday night at 6pm it just doesn ' t happen .
This italian resto is little overpriced for the food received . Nothing really impressed me .
The style and quality went downhill recently and its always unorganized and crowded .
It ' s one of the few decent Japanese restaurants in Madison . I used to hit this place a lot in college .
Replaced Serendipity outside Caesars . Smaller portions and more expensive . Nice service .
Food isn ' t bad and open late , but it ' s so pricey . $ 18 for breakfast food and $ 21 flor lunch food . Not late cheap eats !
Okay burgers . Unlimited toppings for no extra charge . Awesome fries . Cool soda machine .
The orange chicken was great . . . it was light and refreshing . The ramen on the other hand was less undesirable . Maybe it was an off day but it really had no flavor to it .
So I love the bar . However I had a visa gift card from Christmas that I could not use . Not cool
Salades , sandwiches and more to go or to eat in one of the 3 tables availables . . Cafeteria food .
I like the fact that this location is clean and organized , but the inventory is poor and runs low on merchandise often .
Actually I am not a big fan of this restaurant . The paella here was good but to me not very impressive .
Good was hot and fast . . . Sat in cantina section . Kelly was our server and sucked . don ' t get her . . .
Chicken was good and hot . Inexpensive meal , especially w / coupons .
Very nicely appointed place , nicely done . The Thai tea was just okay , and although the Phad Thai was tasty , it was real greasy . I may try it again , may not ,
Decent food . I try hard to like bagels more , but maybe i should just give up . Service here is hit or miss .
Service is usually good . Food doesn ' t take long . Drinks could be a little stronger . . .
Was ok , staff was super friendly and accommodating , but rooms were kinda cheaply designed .
Average food cheap beer . They are pretty standard but it is a good place if you want to get a cheap buzz . Used to go here a lot when I lived in chandler for the food .
S ' allrite 4 TempEasy . brunch food = breakfast + lunch . usually pretty busy . i ' d much prefer The Good Egg .
It ' s been a bit of time since I ' ve been here . Rode there with some friends after a meeting . Food and service was very good .
The service was not all that great . We got the buffet , which was pretty good just not a lot of options . The cinnamon sticks were delicious .
Costs 50 - 60 dollars to take in my suit jacket . If I knew it was that much I wouldn ' t have even went . Elevator to the room is also super slow
Grabbed some take out and service was quick ! Decent food with pretty standard prices .
Everything about this place is mediocre . Meh .
EXPENSIVE ! ! Not sure it was worth the $ , but the food was good and the wait staff was very friendly . We had a pretty decent time overall .
If the service was a little more then I ' d give those a much higher rating . Otherwise the three stars is for the food itself .
$ 1 beer was nice , but wing was hard as rock , I asked if this was harder than usual but they said that was the one I should enjoy . . . not for me .
Decent dim sum . . stars deducted for difficulty finding entrance . Service was okay . Address of restaurant was different from entrance of restaurant . . total confusion at first .
Always great find but really disappointed having to pay for refills on ice tea . I drop them a star for that
a few deserts . only 2 display cases so limited selection . Cakes are the same as everywhere but a bit more pricey for the MEC crowd .
Have been sent to this buffet by the tour group twice within 7 days . Food is just ok for us Chinese .
Decent selection , decent prices . It ' s your average liquor store . The staff was helpful and friendly . Not sure what else I can say about it .
Friendly staff but service is very slow . . waited for my food for 20 min . Reuben is what I always order & there was barely any sauerkraut , I knew it tasted different
Can ' t get to picky when eating after - hours . I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and it was just average . I wish I had order something else .
Long lines but very fast service . The sweet potatoe option is the way to go . The fish is fried - not good at all .
Good place to take your pets . Would recommend calling ahead for an appointment .
Got the latke grilled cheese - yummy but very small . Salad was also small . Service was good , nice ambience .
Cool atmosphere . Something which was missing at uptown Toronto . Food is hit and miss . You gotta know Japanese food to be able to order the good dishes .
This a cool place in a great area . Great coffee and beer choices . I just hate some of the cliental . The students studying and taking up a whole table to themselves is BS .
Very Very dirty I don ' t know how the health dept . doesn ' t do something . The food is good and looks like it ' s family owned n operated just need cleaning
So so service Good food but poor service . . . . Wine was not great and they only had one type of soju . Would probably not come back again gor sub par food and service .
Nothing spectacular here . The price is the only reason to eat here . Ribs , orange chicken and turkey was good . However many of the stations food were not edible . Dessert was ok .
I was craving for something relatively healthy and I found this place . The food is okay . They are fast at making orders and they are cheap .
Decent , no frills place for Korean BBQ . The waiters are swift service wise but neglected changing the base for the grill . Limited but solid selection of protein and banchan .
Waited on a glass of wine for 15 minutes and the waiter wasn ' t very with it . The food was great especially the chicken . The main downside is the price point .
Solid , local place to meet up with friends .
Good music and packed on a Saturday night . They force you to check in your coat right at the door . Bartenders don ' t really seem to be attentive or skilled . Crowd is twenty somethings .
good coffee . too much robotic texting hipsters and boring upper middle class white people . . but good coffee ! also the baked goods are tasty . the people are the main downer .
Came for dinner with my boyfriend . Food here is just OK . Nothing is amazing . The most delicious dish for me is Osaka Cha - Han . The stuff is very nice .
In case you decide to make a trip out . . . This place has closed their doors for good .
I wasn ' t overly impressed with their tacos . Definitely not my first choice when it comes to Mexican .
Doesn ' t matter how good your food is if the service is bad . . . Place has potential with the right servers !
I ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza . The slices were big but I was shocked that the total was $ 7 . 45 . The food was good but too pricey to me just for pizza
This place was pretty cool - the wait staff comes out to your car to take orders and deliver the food - like Happy Days ! I had the veggie burger and pumpkin shake . Damn good .
Their poutine / fries are so good ! However , all the pasta dishes are rather flavourless and disappointing .
I ' m from Philly so I know a good cheesesteak . The cheesesteak wasn ' t bad , but the rolls are definitely not Philly cheesesteak quality .
Just ate there for the first time . . Tons of topping and very filling
Its a subway , good choice of sandwiches and the service is good . * serves coke products
This store has some pretty funny sayings on shirts and other items like key chains and bumper stickers . If you don ' t have any gift ideas , you should definitely come here for some humorous items .
Went on a weeknight and it was empty . The lemon drop martini was yummy .
Not like the old location ; very noisy and really slow service . The food however is authentic and delicious . I ' m 50 / 50 on returning . That polka band was good ; yet annoy
Typical asian buffet food , nothing special to separate it from Spoonful or Mandarin except that it is a bit more spacious inside .
It ' s a good 20 mins from Epic - shuttle provided . Good Breakfast . First room given smelled like dog but staff moved me to a new room . Staff is accomodating and friendly .
Good burgers and the service was very friendly . My first impression was that it was sort of a dive bar . But the food and drinks were good and the music was loud .
Drinks are good . Staff is nice but when it ' s busy efficiency takes precedence . You earn stars for purchases but can ' t redeem rewards .
Yo man , this is some seriously good coffee . . . . in the middle of nowhere , but good . The employees are pretty brusque though , not a fan , and not friendly .
There pizza was alright they are open late and the place I usually order from was closed . It didn ' t compare to the place I usually order pizza From .
A bit on the pricier side because it ' s on the strip . But great to have a boba spot in PH !
Foods great . Method of ordering to go is treacherous . Don ' t bother calling . Just spend 5 minutes online . Then drive there .
Ok food bad atmosphere needs that guy on Fremont street playing an accordion better than soul at Italian restaurant !
Good barbecue , poor service . Appetizers were alright . Bulgogi was average , good short rib and brisket as well as the filet mignon .
Does great work as a barber hard as hell to get in though . Got to the point where I had to schedule appointments a month ahead of time . Everything else is great .
The food is typical Chinese fair . The menu was changed about a year ago , and portion size was cut down . The service is always good . The restaurant is clean as well .
Good classic bar food and then some . $ 5 burgers every Tuesday after 5pm . Good cocktails . Calamari good but portion looks deceiving as lettuce lays below calamari .
Cool location but I found the pizza to be kinda average . The Italian hoagie was good . Parking was a nightmare .
The only reason why this place deserves 3 stars is because their fruit cocktails are delicious . Service is terrible . The register lady is extremely unprofessional and makes rude remarks to colleagues about customers .
I did not find the girls to be friendly or patient with me as a new customer . I do however like Rubio food so we will probably stick to ours .
Nothing bad about this place and nothing all that special either . They have a huge patio and outdoor bar , which is what I liked about it the most .
We ordered 5 different pastas for the 6 of us . The pastas were fine . The service were bad , our waiter inattentive .
I wish I had read the reviews before ordering here . The fries were great and the burger was s solid burger but lacked a bit of Spice . Good overall experience .
I find this pizza very mediocre . It is more crust than toppings and can be very doughy . I will rarely get this and only if I am like right next door and super hungry .
I ' m saying late forties plus . Great for mom and dad who want to swing dance . Not sure if the crowd gets younger later but I ' m not sticking around to find out
Been going for years and it ' s still good and always so busy and that ' s a good thing for the employees and owner ! As for me I would go again ! No regrets !
Solid pizza , decent appetizers and ok service . The location is perfect for a summer night . The pizza itself is good but other restaurants are making better pizza at the moment .
Nice ambient , but don ' t recall the food as being spectacular . The drinks were delicious , special creations . Nice outdoor patio area .
Not bad ! At the same time not as flavorful as other more authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the region
The tacos are ok . I wish the chicken was a bit more seasoned and less smoky . I love the interior design though . The place has cool vibes .
bought sour pork saturday nite . i was dissappointed . meat was not fresh . i end up throwing food away
Stopped in here for a beer on a Saturday night . Great selection of beers and the food looked good . Very busy on a Saturday night , but the staff seemed to handle the customers with ease .
Expensive dog treats . Very nice place but everything is very high end . I do like the fact that they offer dog cakes . Great for last minute type parties for the pups .
Pretty ordinary Dennys , didnt make it to the pancake special though dang it . Quite convenient to where we stayed at , motel 6 . Not good nor bad , just Dennys .
This venue needs to pick a name and stick to it . Like , identity issues much ? But I ' ve seen some pretty incredible shows here . Pro tip : bring a flask .
Their selection of baked goods is really awesome and their sandwiches are really yummy but the customer service is definitely lacking . There are some friendly employees but majority of them are not very personalable .
Fine by me . It ' s your typical Jack In the Box . Our order was correct , fast , and friendly .
The food and service are great , but not a completely authentic Korean experience . Would have liked to see the Korean food names on the menu .
Produits locaux et importés à perte de vue , j ' y retournais n ' importe quand ! Petit hic , ils n ' acceptent pas le crédit donc apportez de l ' argent liquide ou votre débit .
Every thing was good the only problem I had was the flank was not up to par , sad thing they will be closing end of the month
Not as good as I remembered . Fajitas were kind of tasteless and the refried beans were cold . Good guacamole , though .
Went for brunch and got the blue corn buttermilk waffle with the spicy mango glazed bacon . . . yum ! Great wait staff , nice mellow atmosphere and good food !
The pizza was yummy yum yum but five dollars a slice kind of on the high side . A whole one is like 16 . 00 in the restaurant . The pepperoni is small and curly .
Can ' t really complain about the food . It was good . Service was as good as you would expect . For the $ $ $ go to Gordon Ramsay steak or del Frisco .
Ici c ' est les nouilles la spécialité ! ! ! ! On a aimé les dumplings grillés , les rouleaux de printemps étaient excellents . Vraiment pas cher ! ! ! ! !
I wouldn ' t come here for the sushi . Funny huh ? I love their dessert bar .
I wanted to try Dim Sum but it ended at 1500 : - / I came a few mins too late - ended up getting orange chicken & Mongolian beef . Chicken had a perfect crispiness to it
Cool decor . Great beers . Expensive . Sausages felt more like novelty than things I ' d want to eat regularly . Fries in duck confit not good .
It ' s a fairly standard Subway . Nothing really all that special , but the staff is generally very nice . The parking is decent but it ' s not the biggest lot .
The food is savory but I ' m just not satisfied with their portions . And the service is not great neither .
Chain restaurant so expect that . No chef here . Lots of prepackaged food heated on site . Nothing memorable Won ' t be back
Foods decent , fun to take people to as a tourist thing .
We usually stay here everytime we come . The price is right and rooms are clean . We never win here but the sport center is awesome . I recommend to see game here
I am a regular in pho world . . and this place is just . . . . . average . Nothing awesome about this place . . especially when there is so much competition in Mesa area .
Dimsum is just okay . Thats all i can say since ive always ordered To Go .
I can ' t help it , I love the chicken tacos . Why do they have to be soo cheap & tasty ! ?
Subway sandwiches chain location convenient to Lawrence Ave W and Jane Street , Toronto , ON
First time here for the wife and I . It was ok the place has great appeal but the food was ok . A place to Go and check it out .
Another " antique mall " with just about no antiques in fact just about no vintage items at all tons of decorator items . Very nicely air - conditioned b
Nice place to just hang out . Many options to choose from . I found the pasta to be ok . The desserts were good and we enjoyed them .
This place is value for money , but I ' m giving it 3 stars due to the lingering musty carpet smell . Coffee maker takes half an hour to brew 2 cups but guest service is excellent .
Really nice staff . The cheeseburger was nothing special but by no means bad at all . Had a few beers and they were pretty good as well . I ' ll return .
I had the ribs and the smoked bean The ribs were good but I was kinda hoping for more out of this place . The smoked bean were really good
Easily the best burger franchise on Canada . Consistent quality in each restaurant . Staff are friendly and service is fast . One fries is good for two .
Biggest sushi in town ! If you ' re not satisfied with one then get all you can eat if you dare . Thanks to chef Kim !
Pretty decent place for Indian lunch buffet . They never replaced any of the food while we were there though , and the service is less than friendly . The food is decent .
Appetizers are really good . The Entrees are pretty average .
Nothing to rave about . It was like any other sausages or polish sausages I have had . Nothing to make you want to jump up and get one .
Great beer selection . Good food . Subpar service . I really want to patronize this place more but 2 visits and both with crappy service makes it tough .
Not a super good spicy Chinese food restaurant but fair enough .
Had the ribeye medium well my jaw hurts From chewing should of got it med Waiter was bad should of told me
Feels a slight bit pricey , but overall tasty food and very friendly service . That about sums it up I think . Not remarkable , but definitely good enough .
We have tried this place twice and the food was decent , but the atmosphere and service is lacking .
The food is on the good side . . the place always seems like it could use a good cleaning . . and the service could be a bit faster .
The food was amazing , but portions were small . Great fun atmosphere , but it got really loud as the place packed out . Not sure i would go back .
Parking is pretty tight . Interesting place - - - - a wide selection of items for cheap prices . Would recommend if you don ' t mind the crowds . Will come back again .
At the end of my stint in Kent , Hungry Howies opened up . This store was responsible for giving some poor girl more dutch ovens than she could shake a stick at !
Overall menus seem to be quite salty
Putters itself was nice but trying to order lunch took FOREVER ! The bartender had to call her three times and I ' m still waiting , ready to go to McDonald ' s .
Pretty good , but the food pales in comparison to it ' s sister restaurant Blue Taj IMO . That said , they have a much better ambiance than Blue Taj .
Chain mexican food catering to caucasians . There are some novel things like making guac table side and good queso but the entrees isn ' t really that good at all .
Service was very good with friendly and helpful bar staff . . . . But the bathrooms need serous help do yourself a favor and stop in the casino first .
We had breakfast . The food was solid but not memorable . The Josephina omelette came with a nice cheese sauce that I liked . Coffee could have been better . The restaurant can use a facelift .
As far as post offices are concerned , this one is descent and quick .
A voir , rien que pour l ' ambiance , le graffiti , les gens , et les foufounes electriques
Very friendly older guys , but my break cables were all taped into my bike with black tape . Not the most professional job . But whatever it was cheap - ish .
Decent draft selection . Nice " real " place off the strip . Great place to get out of the sun and enjoy a few pints in the afternoon .
Food , service , ambiyance , value : 3 . 5 / 5 Repeat : Likely if I ' m in the neighbourhood . Guu at Church & Jarvis is still my favourite .
Le café est bon , le décor est sympa , par contre le service n ' est pas du tout courtois . Malheureusement , pour moi , ce dernier point est particulièrement important .
Good . But overpriced . Nice environment . Decent coffee and pantries but too much money for what you get .
Its okay . the food is good the service ok . Although I do like their outside porch and dine in area .
Went for a late dinner around 10 / 11pm ! Ordered the Boneless Chicken with Green Onion to share and it was pretty good . I still think The Fry is more worth it for the price though !
kitchen is excessively slow and sometimes not very attentive service . but the food is consistently good for the price .
Joy ' s Cafe closed down , but it re - opened as Gigi ' s Place . the food is still mediocre , but the cashier is much friendlier now !
Nice atmosphere but the place is small and they did not have that great of a variety when I went there for breakfast . Their granola is great but acai bowl was ok . . not too tasty .
An elegant atmosphere with upper tier drinks and food . I was underwhelmed with the quality , my pasta wasn ' t satisfactory in consistency or flavor .
I enjoyed a double cheeseburger with no bun ( wrapped in lettuce ) and extra mushrooms . I still perfer In and Out for the food and price .
The bartender was way cool , makes great drinks . Good looking menu .
Convenient place to eat if you ' re shopping at Mekong Plaza . The food is authentic and good , but not great .
I ' ve been coming to this Sonic since i was a kid and never had a problem until tonight when they gave me month old expired cheese with my pretzel . That shit is dangerous lol
when i need an afternoon driinnk this is where i shop . ah swear the sleectin is famazing ! thhhey have the frnliyest stayff and great wine prixceesszz . ok i gotta go i ' m hungry
Just another BOSA doughnut . Cereal really doesnt belong .
Service usually sucks . Two order spots but never used . Coming in and out is so narrow surprised not more accidents .
It was good , big portions , with tasty biscuits .
I had Americano , it was ok , didnt have any strength of espresso . Lot of seating space though , nice decor
The darts machine is fun to play on . The pool tables were ok . Bathroom stall was broken , so that made some of the experience shitty ( literally ) .
Small Place but nice and clean they have an extensive menu with good variety first time here and not disappointed prices are accessible so def will come back
Great spot for breakfast . Apparently frequented by the locals . We were pleased to find a simple country cooking spot for breakfast .
First time here . Large operation , staff friendly . . manager " Dallas polite and respectful . . good rates . . will add more after first wash
They got order wrong . . n it was just 3 tacos . . . the taste was good . Not the best it lacks a little flavor .
Went to check it out . The daily special was the cheeseburger and fries and we had the jalapeño caps . They were interesting . Food was ok . Music was really loud . Staff was awesome .
I ' ve eaten there several times . I won ' t rave about it , but it ' s filling .
Bad news : management modified the menu and dropped our favorite breakfast items including eggs Benedict and pancakes . Now there is little reason to choose Chelsea ' s over less expensive options .
A good place to eat some Japanese food . The udon is really good n prepared fresh daily .
The sandwich shop part is awesome ! It is also a great place that price matches the large grocery stores on liquor . Friendly and fast on call in orders .
Quick service for take out , tasty teriyaki chicken . I was not as impressed by the orange chicken , frier may have been a bit cool that day . Good variety and good prices .
Good not great Need a better lunch menu and Taco Tuesday special I will go back if in the area , but won ' t go out of my way
Lacking in atmosphere . Music ? I dont even remember . Beers are a bit pricey . Bartenders weren ' t extremely friendly either . The food makes up for the rest .
the hotel is great except . . . . . who decided that the checkout time is 10am , for real . this is las vegas .
I liked the Beef Stew soup . I ' m used to a more variety of side dishes and kimchees . The service was good , and the place clean . Not bad for $ 20 AYCE .
I like the dank lighting but always feel yuk afterwards . Hard to rate a chain place but as RLs go it is ok .
Fun place to get wet in the summer heat . This park has a large wave pool but not a lot of slides . Found the slides just OK . Think they are over due for something new .
Loved the American Blonde and gram ' s oat soda IPA . Good service . Egg rolls were very good . Our bar tender was very attentive and helpful in selecting the beers .
Seriously , they don ' t have no one on the floor to assist . 2 employees upstairs only to cashier . No wonder why they are losing money .
Reasonable priced for the quantity served , very large servings . Taste was average to good . a little more homemade quality than fast food .
Had Chamango for the first time . It was just okay . Loads of sugar . Had nacho cheese . Chips were very stale . Good try once but would not come back . Staff is very pleasant .
My order that was done online was incorrect , and the delivery took quite sometime . Food was delivered under room temp . However , food was still good .
I tend to avoid this location during peak times . It is snail paced slow , goes the same at any other Wendy ' s . I ' ve never had a problem with any order though .
Great corporate Italian atmosphere . . Very attentive staff clean environment and food okay . . def a must try and be back soon . ! '
Bon petit Resto ! Un 3 . 5 agréable et bon ! Sans prétention ! Prix raisonnable ! Calmars frits , pizza , crème brûlée !
Provided what I was needed however sales associate seemed to be particularly grumpy . Wish he could have been in a little bit better mood and engaged me as a customer .
Great food . The restaurant ' s aesthetic is beautiful , but it ' s insanely noisy and the wait staff are on the rude side .
The food menus were creative . Location was very convenient . Salads were great but the rice noddles dish that I have tried did not tasted that great .
First time here , service was mediocre . No one explained anything when I asked . Homeboy scooping the rice hates his life
Rotisserie pulled chicken sandwich , awesome . Mac - n - cheese side , awesome . Noise level above engine of a 747 , not awesome .
Its ok here . needs more stores . There is more restaurants then department stores . They do have good restaurants .
Pitas rapides très honnêtes . Bien aimé mon sandwich Shish Taouk au poulet . Le monsieur qui m ' a servie était bien gentil tout comme celui à la caisse . Clientèle jeune et majoritairement masculine .
Had free comp $ $ To spend . Took 3 people and we all thought average at best . Steak not seasoned and took 10 minutes to refill a coke .
This is an Okay buffet . I went there for lunch and food selection is alright . Mostly Asian food compare to buffet on Stripe . Price is a little more expensive compare to buffet in LA area .
If duck , duck fat and truffle oil means you can charge $ 30 for 10 nachos and call it gourmet , enjoy ! One meal was enough for me .
while the gelato was fine , the ambiance of being in an underground mall was not quite the Montreal atmosphere i was looking for .
Resto à burritos formule clean . . Ca fait divertissement mais si vous êtes un cochon commandez tout en double pour couvrir votre faim . .
Good fucking lord . 22 $ for 20 wings ? 96 cents for ranch . Wtf . . . . Never again wingstop .
The service is so bad here ! The dim sum is ok . It takes forever to get them to come to the table for more Dim Sum . I rather go to other local places for Dim Sum
Grade : C Classic cheap , greasy breakfasts . Good service . I just can ' t get all that excited about eggs .
Decent nails for price . They ' ve cut me a few times during the manicure because they ' re in such a hurry .
Food was good and seamed reasonably priced , but the service was pretty slow . Margaritas were nothing special . It ' s not located close to me , so I probably won ' t be back .
KFC has a pretty good lunch special for $ 5 . 00 . chicken , biscuit , mashed potatoes and a drink . Good place for a quick cheap lunch .
Fried rice here tasted like steam rice while the beef taste so old . However , the panang curry and Tom yum soup got them 3 stars overall rating .
Coffee is ok but nothing exceptional , deserts too ( I had a scone ) . A bit overpriced . Nice decor .
Was not very happy with this location . The manager was great , but staff needs to communicate better with their customers . I am not happy at all .
While other shops had wait times , they took my vehicle right away and gave me some great deals . Yay !
We liked waiter food was ok - but it took 20 minutes for a beer ? ? ? ? ? Average decent happy hr
Coffee was crack in a cup but nasty tasting . The grand slam was half the taste of Denny ' s and the cakes were half the size . The service was excellent . Thanks Brandon .
the food is good , but the selection is not that large , and they aren ' t fans of doing any substitutions .
A good place to go when you are shopping downtown and you do not really want to venture out to try something new and interesting . It is always really good service and the dishes are always ok .
Summer volleyball is great here . Good atmosphere awesome staff . Food and drinks are a little pricey but still delicious . Fun place to relax with friends .
The ribs were burnt but the music outside was cool . . The bartender was very nice . The place is very clean . I lost my id there but overall the place was okau
Located in the center courtyard of the Venetian you find this Great spot for gelato . Plan to spend at least 45 mins and enjoy the live music .
Probably one of the better places in Montreal for Dim Sum . But come early and get a number because on the weekends this place is always packed !
We checked in late and got two free passes which we had an hour to use before it closed . It was okay . Surprisingly good : Orange chicken Mediocre : Dolmas , crab cakes
I have low expectations for airport food , but this place wasn ' t bad . The breakfast burrito beat the other McChains in the terminal .
Guacamole was amazing ! The rest of the food was only mediocre . Have to see we were disappointed ! Not your typical Triple DDD quality . Won ' t go back .
Great coffee and space . I may have just caught them on a bad day , but the staff is not super friendly and makes you feel like an idiot if you are not a coffee snob .
Club is always clean and cool . Staff is happy , friendly and attentive . Please install a faucet to fill water bottles as found in other gyms I belong to .
Food is consistently great but DON ' T GO WHEN YOU ' RE HUNGRY the service is so slooooow
It ' s quiet , but too many stairs for me . On the bright side , it doesn ' t smell like urine , so that ' s a definite bonus .
Alright pizza for 10 bucks at lunch . Raspberry iced tea was good and the waiter was sincere .
Sadly disappointing . So many great options in Las Vegas . Looked inviting , but cocktails and food were under whelming . Sorry Bobby .
buying a bottle of wine to share while watching ' inception ' was probably the most bourgie - ghetto thing i have ever done . so , really , i recommend doing this .
It was OK . I ' m from a big city , and I don ' t like how you can ' t keep an eye on your toddlers . This gym is best suited for older kids .
Pretty good . There coupons make it a good deal . The only downside is they charge a $ 1 . 00 to use a debit card which is crazy to me . . . .
Just wanted naan it took them about an hour , but naan was really good hence the three star
The nachos were good but the margaritas were extremely over priced , they tasted good and looked pretty but I ' m not sure if there was any alcohol in them at all .
Nice and clean looking store ( it ' s new ) with all the possible styles and sizes . BUT the prices are high in my opinion .
Your only choice for movies if you ' re on the east side . Older theater shows the current films but don ' t expect anything extraordinary from here .
Your typical nail salon , nothing too special about this one . Although they did give a much longer foot massage than usual with my pedicure !
The Livermore is a new place with old charm , solid drinks , and an ambience that left me unimpressed .
I guess if you are flying First Class it ' s not a bad way to spend an hour drinking free cocktails .
strong rum and coke epitome of a dive bar peep the murals towards the back for a journey through time ; )
Stopped here randomly while staying at local hotel . Really nice server who happily seated me near a plug for my dead phone . Had chicken souvlaki in pita with Greek salad .
Good food but they need more help . 2 ahead of me but still waiting 20 minutes so far . . . .
Food is decent . Drinks are good . They no longer make the drink I loved . The service on busy weeks is not good ( i . e furry convention ) , but not a bad resturant
It ' s a good fun place for happy hour . The food is decent , won ' t exactly blow you away , but the drinks are pretty great .
Delivery was fast . Delivery man was very polite . Typical fast food . Tasty and fresh . I would order from here again .
Overall good is good . Curry is awesome . As for the service . It ' s ok . . . Takes a while to get things . Nice bar to hang out and a entertainment stage .
Good sushi and great infused sake ! Gets a little packed on the weekends but is a fun crowd .
Huge portion of breakfast / brunch to start a day . Scrambled eggs are my favorite . But too bad they don ' t accept cards : (
I got the duck fat fries with chipotle sauce . Not really impressed and would not get that again . I may come back to try the sausage .
Food is quite good and portions are big . Service could be a little bit better and friendlier , Their dishes are very tasty , but a little bit on the expensive side .
Good view but furniture is in bad shape . Slow service . Average food . Good for change though .
Pretty good bagel , but more of a fan of St Viateur . Fairmount is more expensive and less tasty . Still great to stop by and compare .
Good food , long . wait even with reservations , What ' s the point in making reservations if I have to wait for an hour to get in ? ? ?
The shop contacted me to offer an explanation for the issue on my previous review and reimbursed me $ 50 .
These guys have a solid place . They were finally able to accommodate my gluten intolerance with a lettuce wrap . The fish tacos were great .
Ok food but portion is a bit small . Service was fine . It is marginal between 3 and 4 stars . Compared to hot and spicy crawfish just across the street , this one is better .
I tried this place and I was a little overwhelmed by the menu i order the salmon kabobs it was really good I also really enjoyed their hummus as well
Never going to make it . Difficult and complicated to order what you want , and overly expensive . Food was ok , but not good enough to go back , given the competition .
Nice pool . Good location away from the busy strip but still close enough to see and be seen .
i like the chicken biryani i like the lamb curry i like the beef samosa but the lady took my money , than started putting onions on the meat with out washing hands .
Lovely atmosphere and friendly servers . The food is just ok . Too saucy and salty . Nothing that special , starting with the stale white bread . It was ok but we won ' t be back .
Just regal food like in food court , nothing special but expensive . It is not worth you money .
It was a long wait but we were given 2 50 % off coupoms . Am using 50 % off this week Everyone is nice today .
Good but Prescott Valley is best so far outside of Bay Area .
Greek salad with the Gyro meat was Delish ! The beef was a little dry and the hummus wasn ' t great though
Not a big store but usually staff is helpful and friendly . They will pricematch which is nice and there is a scale in front of the Banfield desk if you want to weigh your poochismo !
I wanted a smoothie . . it was just way too sweet ! But there are lots of awesome choices .
Pizza by the slice right at the south end of Fremont Street in the remodeled Plaza Hotel Casino . Open late too .
They have special discounts on wings on Wednesday . Not the best , but good for a grad student ! : )
I recommend the goat cheese flatbread , wings and avocado stack but we didn ' t care for the hummus or the short ribs .
Kinda dead on a Friday . More people should come down its got a nice atmosphere . Good beers good spirits semi good company .
good for watching sports but they may have a limited menu during popular games . parking isnt ideal and it can get pretty clubby once the games are over .
My server messed up my order as i asked not to add a feta cheese in my lamb burger but over all it was a nice evening . Atmosphere inside was great . Server was nice .
Saw this restaurant on Guy Fieri triple D and I had to stop by ! The food prices are really affordable and the carne asada burrito was good ! I would love more seasoning Or salt .
Not a bad hotel , just too far off the strip . Good for the convention center tho .
Cool spot to be after work if you ' re in Mississauga . Atmosphere is cool and casual . Service is kind of slow but friendly . Food was okay .
Food is ok . Over priced . Smell in dining area is disgusting . Smells like a dirty grease trap . Only 24 . Hour place in ceasars for food .
This is the closest to Waffle House in the south . . . THE PERFECT DRUNK FOOD !
Grabbed burger from here like once , and it was acceptable but never felt compelled to go back since there are great bars and whatnot around the area to go to instead .
Everything great but you can ' t access balconies which is a major negative and somewhat depressing .
Meh . Nothing is wrong but nothing is special . OK for a group lunch but not a dinner place for me .
Walked around here for a bit . It seems clean and well run . Much bigger than I thought it ' d be . Didn ' t get a chance to play any games
parking is , meter street , garage or paid lot . French Fries are really good and decent sandwiches . Good place to go when you ' re downtown .
The steaks are good the atmosphere is nice for green valley . You might as well go to the strip where you ' ll get better service for the same price
Food and service are ok but this place constantly smells like sour bar rags . Change them out now and again - yuck
Ended up cancelling my membership as the classes weren ' t what I was looking for . The place was clean , had decent equipment and the staff was friendly .
This place is a great Smoothie / Acai bowl place not sure how healthy they ' re smoothies are cause they taste pretty sweet but they make a great desert either way !
I got the unlimited soup and salad for lunch and of course it was amazing . The service is pretty quick so it ' s safe to come here for lunch !
Huge portion sizes . One sandwich is plenty for 2 people . Kind of expensive for a deli but the food was good . Conveniently located next to the Cleveland clinic .
I ' ve always found this pizza to be kind of bland , just not enough flavor for me . I do enjoy their steak hoagies and the fries are good as well
When light is on they just melt in your mouth . . . however the slow service made the wait difficult . But still irresistible .
If you have an appointment be prepared to wait 15 - 20 minutes after your scheduled time to see someone . Also flagging someone down to help you is difficult and confusing .
I don ' t have much to add other than when I go , I find it pretty easy to get around . Though , I can understand the suicidal comment . Nice !
Their main bar is currently undergoing renovations . The walls have been repainted and the barstools upgraded . More to come as renovation progresses .
Great coffee and decent food . Prices are about average . Their help is the only thing that needs work . Very unfriendly young kids working . A smile and some courtesy would take them much further .
Tasty burgers . Whadda - ya - waaant ?
We just went here this past saturday with a party of 8 . I would have to say that the overall food was good but , nowhere near the quality of Ocean Club in Kierland commons .
This place is decent but I probably won ' t be returning . I got the shrimp tacos and they were ok . I also remember it being very dark in the restaurant and the atmosphere being weird .
This was not a good experience . My drink tasted too sugary ! And the customer service was horrible , I can ' t believe this was a Starbucks since all the other ones have much better service .
Pho was good not the best I had . . owner or manager rude to busser in front of our table
Come early . . . or you ' ll be in line forever .
Went for Brunch this past Sunday . The crepes were good . My omelet was good but overall the price is high for what you get . Atmosphere just ok .
Room was clean & nice ecept the refrigerator barely worked & the sink drains really really slow . We liked the free breakfast & coffee .
They are short staffed and slow for lunch rush . People just give up and leave hungry !
Marginal at best . Great looking place , poor service , food was just " okay , " nothing special . I was disappointed as I love french food .
Lots of stores , even more people . . . expensive and stressful . Maybe I ' m just not a mall person .
Good food but the last 3 times they have gotten my order wrong . I guess I should have checked it before I left .
Service is good and friendly . Best Patty Melt in the valley . Careful on hours of service , they close up shop too early . Nice view of the golf course and 4 Peaks
My local subway station that appears to be under perma - construction . I don ' t know why . The bus I have to take seems to run semi - regularly . ' Nuff said .
Very good just needed red or green sauce for my burrito and taco but taste fine satisfied with the service will visit again soon
Always reliable for a great Burger , cold beer and friendly service . Chain food yet worth it . And Mondays kids under 12 ( I think ) eat free !
Just ok . Tiny cupcake and the texture is too soft , and scant amount of frosting for a regular size .
The service was average , the food was better than expected , but came out of the kitchen in a staggered manner .
It got a failed rating from the county health board
Great if you like waiting for 35 minutes , after calling half hour ago . Annoying as hell .
Was visiting someone in the hospital . Stopped by for supper . Parking was very limited . The food was excellent . Service so - so . Had pizza and wings .
Really neat place to find resources and books to movies . Hang a while and see all the books , glassware , toys , videos , instruments , cds and movies .
We really enjoyed everything we had there , and we love our mexican food . I wish there was one closer to Henderson , because it is really a drive .
Not the best location for this chain of restaurants . The atmosphere is nice but the food selection wasn ' t the greatest . There are definitely better hot pot places in the chinatown area toronto
Sardella ' s is my favorite pizza chain in the valley , but this a good substitute in Surprise . Tastes similar to Sardellas , good wings .
