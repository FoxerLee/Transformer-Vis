Really bad customer service , the lady at the phone was super rude when I was trying to order a delivery . So rude that she hang up on me
Disappointing recently as i use to go all the time but now buttered chicken was watery
Food was ok nothing to write home about . Service super slow . 1 person for a 45 plus seat restaurant is crazy ! Don ' t think I would come back ! 44 $ and still hungry .
Not a fan at all ! . Tastes like McDonald ' s to be honest ! . Burger was cold and no flavor at all .
Not impressed . Service was slow . Price was too high for the small portion . Savory choices would be welcome .
Went and bought a comforter set it was used and dirty and filthy on the inside the pillows were stained and they hid it by turning them inside so you couldn ' t see from the outside
Read good reviews and was so disappointed . Went there for lunch . Service was slow ( there were only a few people there ) and the food was terrible ( not cooked well and no flavor ) .
Be aware of the fact that they rent dry and you need to wait until Landmark gets around to fueling your aircraft after you return . I waited over 45 minutes to finally settle my bill ! !
We ordered two milkshakes and it took over 20 minutes . Service was not good . First and only time coming here
Worst McDonald ' s ever . 2 people ordering but 30 people waiting . Wrong orders . It ' s actually hillarious anyone can run something this bad
Had the special at 3 pm if it matters . Mediocre marinara and odd tasting meatballs . The ambiance is great but the quality of food as a franchise would . Not memorable at all
Way over priced . Had a bunch of weird Shiet on the menu . Tries way too hard to be hip . Extremely overpriced . But . . . . The wings were good .
Terrible service lied to me about the price over the phone very rude and unprofessional and also refused to accept my coupon that I had .
The subs are just okay : ( but way to expensive for what you get . There are many other sub places to choose from in the area that are much better unfortunately .
This place sucks . Worst tropical smoothie ever . I won ' t be returning to this location ever again .
The ice cream was not fresh and did not have a good texture .
I remember when this place opened years ago and it was great . All it is now is a place for vagrants and garbage to hang around .
Came all the way here to get their pork bone soup . 3hours before they close they said they dont have enough to make one order .
What can I say , the food is nasty , workers are rude and they always run out of something . I have stopped eating at this place and would recommend others to stay away as well .
Tried this place for the first time , wasn ' t very impressed . Overrated , food was ok nothing special to right home about , but we did kill the extra time we had before our show .
Bathrooms were disgusting . If they look like that , what does the kitchen look like ? Saw 2 Cockroaches in bathroom : (
Douche baggery central . Wow . Just , wow . I attempted to eat dinner here , but ultimately decided to take advantage of the Mac ' s next door . Their taquitos were on sale . Delicious .
What a dump ! The food is terrible . The service is awful . The clothes are worse . This is a great place for people with deadened taste buds and color blindness .
Horrible customer service . AND RUDE ! i was trying to talk to an empoloyee and she intentionally turned her back to me to ignore me .
Never again . Not only the food was bad , but service was terrible . Waited 15 mins to get the check and another 10 minutes to get my card back .
Before you place your order , check your watch . They promise 5 minutes but can take 20 to prepare . Wrong order items are a possibility too .
Nice hotel with crappy wireless . When traveling for work you need wifi and this place was bogged down every night to dial up speed , if you could even get onto the network .
The whole place smells like the sewer backed up into it . Thank God I was just there for eye drops ; had I been after food , I couldn ' t have brought myself to eat it .
This is more of a reminder to myself next time I ' m tempted . Hey future self : ‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍
The worst service I have ever had ! Food would have been descent if the waitress was even slightly pleasant . They could not pay me to return to their establishment . Total turn off !
Called for repair . Cable broke on mic after about 6 months . Warranty program is unhelpful and they never called back . I would say avoid their products and find a company that supports their products .
Very disappointed with the food . Chicken lacked flavor and very dry . Veges were bland . For $ 10 I can cook a better and tastier meal than this anytime . Count me out next time .
Ok coffee . But very nice looking place . Not bad for a good relax combo with a friend or colleague
horrible wings they are not lightly dusted . The service was good and so was the lemonade
This room is over priced over a hundred dollars a night with bed bugs and your short on staff
Don ' t go there people The worst service not fresh food rude customer service Employee speaking Spanish between them If I can rate them zero I will
This location is horrible . We ' ve been here several times and they have been out of rice . Last I checked that is a staple when it comes to " Asian " food .
Kim was extremely vulgar and extremely unprofessional to deal with . Would never deal with her again . Very Immature .
The casino is clearly in need of an update . It ' s very old and out of date . The staff was not friendly at all and were pretty rude at the craps tables .
Thank heavens for the tequila . The food was a complete disaster . Chicken was completely and utterly burnt . The remainder of the food was very salty .
FYI Also called DrainPro . Same web site under different names . Check yelp ratings .
These people were extremely rude and wouldn ' t sell me naan because I didn ' t have cash . Certainly won ' t be returning !
Small portions . Staff look very unhappy and are difficult to understand ( mumble ) .
The guy that helped me was rude ! It ' s as if he was just being lazy to look up certain information I didn ' t have , swear I will never go back after today !
Very Friendly Staff , over priced , poorly prepared italian food . Bottom line is that it is simply not worth the effort . My meal was so bad that I sent it back and left .
Pretty much any store on nellis is ghetto . . n i hate walmart anyway . But this particular one is Ghetto . Bums all over the parking lot . N dirty . Nuff said
The food was dry and bland . Ordered the ribs and there was no meat for it was overcooked and burnt . The chicken Ceasars salad had old chicken and the water had a weird sink taste .
This store is as boring to shop there as the employees are ! ! Go to Michaels , same stuff really , only cheaper and more selection ! ! Michaels always has coupons too ! !
Not a very friendly welcome . Our waiter was excellent . Restaurant very small and crowded . Ask for the specials they are much cheaper than regular menu .
Worst food ever trust me don ' t come here , long lines disgusting food never will eat here again worst experience ever
Seems like a place where they only take care of their regulars . I literally had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for another beer . Will not be coming back again .
Can ' t follow simple orders for a delivery . Call before ringing the doorbell . It ' s not hard . Can they do it ? Nope . Terrible .
Don ' t expect good service at the bar . The greenday - haired bartender lives in a bubble . But , they play good music and have good selection on tap .
The Starbucks has always sucked the people that work there don ' t know how to do their job you ' d be better off just getting rid of the kiosk entirely .
Terrible service . For some reason they despise customers . Good food . But a miserable experience . Cheer - up people !
Asked the bartenders some questions about local beers and were abruptly answered with an " I don ' t know " response . I felt they were just down right RUDE ! !
If I could give zero stars I would . They just don ' t care about customer service and are super apathetic .
Not really smoke free . The truth is very heavy smoke from the air conditioner . Its on level 46 . LV doesn ' t have any real smoke free hotel , right ?
Without a doubt , the worst service I ' ve ever experienced in a Restaurant . Ever .
DO NOT eat here ! It is disgusting ! ! My husband and I paid $ 73 for supper and we were gone in less than 10 minutes ! Now we both have stomachaches .
Nothing special except that it ' s filled with all the obnoxious douchebags and foul mouthed drunk sluts from the rehab pool .
Been going there for 6 years , and only half the time they get your order right , and half the time you get everything you ordered . better off going to the one on grand and bell .
My beef with this place , it serves no BEEF ! ! Shawarma purpose defeated Otherwise if you ' re a chicken lover you be fine
Bad food bad service the waitress and manager refused to fix it so we left hungry not the first time this has happened at this location but it is the last time .
All u can eat sushi ! $ 26 . 95 ! ? They even don ' t have Uni ikura , sweet shrimp n fresh scallop ! !
This is a terrible post office ! Many pieces of mail lost or sen back to sender , even tho have lived here for years !
Good food horrible and old DJ . They redeemed the Music Factory for my friends & me since the place next door had them waiting for a drink for 40 mins .
Do not do Biz with this bank ! ! ! ! ! They play games and you will not win . They will mess up your credit ! ! ! And make you waste your money ! ! !
Although it had good flavor my chicken was on the dry side without enough sauce , totally overpriced for what you get , been there done that most likely won ' t go back .
meh . Not impressed . Felt like to me that the mall has gone downhill .
Do you want to wait over an hour for a cold pizza ? and then deal with a jerk manager ? then this is the place for you !
Will not be coming back . The edamame was overlooked , the salad was blah , my hand rolls were bland . The miso soup was the only thing that was ok
Keep on Walking ! Everything is Better ! Bad Food Bad Attitudes Bad Service just extend your game of Dodge the Hookers & Beggars and find Any Place else !
The service is very slow , feels like a disconnect between server and customer . There are other restaurants around with good food , Red Robin your customer service is going to cost you .
The small portion of meat was of very poor quality and it was drowning in too sweet of a sauce .
Not impressed with the food . Service was fair . Atmosphere is a little loud . Might be back but not high up on the list .
Last time they had no beans , this time no rice . Not sure what ' s going on hope they get their act together .
Horrible customer service ! Will never return back ! I highly discourage anyone visiting this place !
I will not be back . Went for the lunch buffet and nothing was fresh . It was worse than Cicis , worse than Peter Piper .
Lousy over cooked corn dog and french fries yuck will not return it Was a good place to eat not anymore So sad
Good , but WAY to expensive to justify . I have to remove one star for that weirdo that dances in their commercials . Disturbing to say the least .
Junk great clips . Long waits , small waiting area . Checked in online , waited for over an hour for my wait time to go down , then was taken off the list .
Was going to go here until I saw " Children Under 5 Not Allowed " . Not only is this distasteful but it is most likely illegal to discriminate against a person based on age .
A fun place to meet friends but beware of the lackadaisical wait staff and the expensive wine leave a lot to be desired .
Worst I have ever eaten ! The fish not fresh ! Small portions , expensive , terrible service . I will never eat here again .
unprofessional why bother doesn ' t answer phone wtf
They may want to consider becoming educated on tattoo lasers before they give out false information again . Lose all credibility when you lie .
Games are okay . However , this place is highly unhygienic . they don ' t clean any silverwares , plates etc . Avoid eating or drinking anything here .
They must have no cleaning people in this town ! This was about the filthiest restaurant I have been in a long time . Who runs this place ? ? Simply disgusting .
Very overpriced and both wonton soup or daily feature hot plate are not taste good . They need to improve their food and soup taste and try to price their food in a more reasonable range !
it made me feel like shit ! vegetables are for rabbits not people ! i pooped my brains out after eating this mess !
So so food . Seriously , nothing special . Hate the atmosphere . Fly ' s everywhere . No air conditioning inside . I will NEVER go back .
Tried 3 times to contact Allison or Tyler the on duty managers about an order that was not placed or handled appropriately . I have had good food their in the past but the service is the worst !
Always looking for good spots while in Phoenix . This was a solid miss . Long wait for mediocre food , so so service and the restaurant environment could have been cleaner .
Forever frustrated with everyone involved in this apartment complex . Unexpected monthly charges and they keep losing my mail then lying about it ! ! ! !
Meth heads work here . I hope one of their teeth didn ' t fall into my smoothie . Omg has this place gone downhill . Obv losing money if the help is this !
Worst dining ever . . . The food was dry and bland . Sushi rice was horrible . The management should really consider redoing the whole place as this shouldn ' t even be called a hotel buffet .
Worse bartender and service I have ever had the bartender Alyssa was rude and needs a few lessons on how to treat customers
Low stocks and somewhat incompetent staff . . no worse than most Walmart in general however .
Tried the sesame chicken and got food poisoning within 30 minutes . My friend warned me that this place gave him food poisoning but i wanted to give it a shot . . . Never again
Can ' t believe they are still in business . Pay double and go to Cerino ' s across the street or Angie ' s a couple miles away . Worth every penny . Pizza Hut is dead .
No water . Also they wasted a lot of plastic . Great people and venue . Just no water . And no sustainability .
Long black hair baked carefully in the center of the pie ! ! Yum Yum !
The Australian , wtf ? ! R . T . O ' Sullivan ' s was way better food . This limited menu is crap , I won ' t be coming back .
Dozens of tables available and servers standing around doing nothing . But they want you to wait 1 . 5 hours . Don ' t waste your time and effort the food can ' t be that good .
This company are complete thieves charged my account twice and also did to a friend on another location ! ! Very unprofessional !
Bad service！ wait for more than 45min to get the food！ they use many excuses to let us wait！wait ！and wait！the food is bad！do not go！粥是隔夜饭做的 . . . 一股电饭锅里的味道 . . .
Over an hour wait for food that never came . Very disappointing . I was going to complain to the manager but she was already getting an ear full from another customer .
The food is decent , but with the handful of times I ' ve been there . . . worst customer service , EVER .
I didn ' t even order the guy at the counter was so rude . . . lucky its subway so it doest really affect them
Steak tasty like a piece of paper . . I was order medium rare , but it comes out almost welldone . Only good thing was size . Size was so huge .
My food was wrong the wait staff couldn ' t be bothered blah food boneless wings too breaded
Terrible service I will never come back Son muy mentirosos Te hacen regresar mil de veces y el carro te lo regresan cmo lo dejaste , creí haber encontrado un buen mecánico pero cmo siempre desepcionan
You are nasty Pete , especially here in Tempe . Fast food , that doesn ' t come out that fast , served by greasy staff in a greasy space .
I was advised there ' s a 30 minute wait for all chicken . How does this KFC stay in business when nothing is available on the menu ? ? ?
I saw that people reported that it was closed but wanted to check for myself and indeed it is closed down
Chicken was really really dry . Gravy and mashed potatoes were uninspiring . Only ate one piece of my half chicken and threw the second piece in the trash .
Food is ok , no restrooms to wash up . . . . bad lunch spot when you only have 30 minutes .
Went yesterday for some breakfast and they are closed for good I ' m guessing number was disconnected and website down : (
Food was very late and the sandwich smelled of sewer . The wait staff was nice and comped the food . Overall if you want this atmosphere , Fatheads is a better choice .
Terrible . Even if you have an appt you still have to wait for the walk ins to be seen if they got there before you . I am changing doctors .
I was just at crown and anchor on east tropicana ! ! And my experience was awful ! ! ! My waitress was fast taking my order but never received my beer after 20 minutes ! ! !
Overpriced . Had to wait 10 minutes to get another drink . Food is acceptable .
Terrible is their name and its for a reason . WAY overpriced . $ 5 . 49 for a gallon of milk . Next time I ' ll go to smiths .
The salad was average but the salmon was awful ! It was over priced for what you get and how you get it ( cafeteria style )
Very disappointing . Everything was incredibly bland , no flavor or heat . I will not order from here again .
We order some appetizers and some desserts . The food looks like it was prepared somewhere else . I thought it was overpriced .
All the workers here are meth heads . The redhead that works nights her voice is annoying
Came to drive thru with carload of people and no service was given at 10 : 50pm . The inside was also closed EARLY while diners were still inside ! ! ! ! RUDENESS ! ! ! !
Super slow service and the food was so - so . Great place if your a student with lots of time to study and not a lot of cash on you .
Scratch the remodeled surface and you ' ll see the dirt : Shady and ghetto , full of weirdos , and the bathrooms are filthy and toilets don ' t flush .
Coffee of the day was super acidic and without any flavor besides that . I have never thrown away coffee after one sip .
Food is average at best and service is hit or miss . Been here a few times . . . never walked away impressed .
Worst case wash ever . Paid to have case washed and waxed . Left vehicle still dirty . Waited 2 hours . . now I will go home and do it myself . Very unhappy !
If staying at a renovated hotel that still has cheap mattresses and staying amongst scorpions is your idea of a good time then this is the place for you ! Don ' t waste your money .
The service is slow food is not even that good its just the same thing as like others
This place has such potential but the coffee was not good , the food was below average and the service was disappointing .
I thought this place would be good . Had the Italian hoagie and noticed right away that the lunch meat was low grade ! ! ! ! TERRIBLE
Frozen meat could literally dye your hotpot to a blackish color . Disgusting . I will give 1 star instead if it isn ' t cheap .
They should really update seasonal times . Its still listed open until 7pm here and on google but store front has a printed sign with a seasonal time and doesnt answer phone calls .
Average food , and pathetic service ! Waiters behave as if they are paid to be rude and arrogant . . Given the choices around I am never going back to this place .
I won ' t be returning to this place . I have been here many times and brought them a lot of business through word of mouth , but the service has gone extremely downhill .
This restaurant used to be good but unfortunately the quality has been slowly declining . The food and services aren ' t as good as they used to be .
They were doing so good I ' m not sure if they changed cook or what but the food just isn ' t like it was in the beginning .
dry meat , basically all one temp . No seasoning , obviously uninspired workers as customer service was awful . Sooo many better options , skip this one .
Horrible service . We didnt even get acknowledged by the cashier / server . They let everyone cut in front of us . We spent money elsewhere . They discriminate against certain groups . Dont go here
Pretty sure this gas station was the one I had my credit card replicated and was fraudulent used in California .
If I could choose less stars I would . Absolutely worse location consistently wrong drinks . Irregularly made . Rather drive out of my way from now on
Sandwiches are waaaaaaaaaay over priced and they were nothing special . Plus you gotta drive around for parking . Def rather go to potbelly
I tried this place today . Very disappointed . The food was very salty and way over - priced . I won ' t be going back anytime soon .
I hate going into this Walmart but it is the closest to my house . Nothing but ghetto employees . And the store is always dirty ! You can tell they hire ANYBODY !
Delivery was quick but the crab puffs horrible , nothing inside . The rice bland , egg roll tasted funny and was burnt . Only good thing was sesame chicken . Never ordering again .
Really bad golf Hot and smokey six dollar beers even if gaming place has nothing to offer
Food was okay , had better . Lady behind counter needs to crack a smile once in awhile . She should find another line of work if shes unhappy . . . just sayin .
The food was below average , waste of time coming here . My bff and I were disappointed .
How frustrating service department ! 2016 Escalade has bad transmission been in on and out for weeks still not working ! Run around lots of talk , take it back !
The ice cream is great but the staff is very rude and doesn ' t make you feel valued as a customer .
As I indicated they won ' t last long ! As someone else indicated the Pizza Gods took action and they are now closed ! ! ! ! ! !
Food was okay but service horrible . Waited for 30 minutes only to have my breakfast sandwich come out wrong ( without egg ) . Should have done Dean and Deluca .
Updated : they simply can ' t get their Americanos done right even with complaints and no I am not picky . . After a few visits with no better results they get a one star review at best
My Thai milk tea taste like water I really disappointed ! I don ' t really rate the tea . I Won ' t buy there again .
you get what you pay for . the food is average , but i found my green curry chicken to have a bit of an after taste .
When purchasing a new vehicle from this dealership BEWARE of business / finance managers and worthless add - ons intended to jack up consumer cost .
Don ' t ever go to genie carwash they are one big ripoff outfit they completely lied about what they can do on a detail waste of time I money ! ! ! ! ! !
This place is horrible and disgusting ! Everything is gloomy and stained there was a cockroach in our room ! ! Please choose any other place except this one !
Even half in the bag this was not great pizza . Average pizza is sooooo easy to make , why couldn ' t they pull it off .
I had a girl literally steal the money I took out of the atm and the charges for one lap dance appeared six times on my credit card . This place is horrible .
Very disappointed to find mold on the cheesecake pieces . Who knows how long these toppings have been sitting here
I order a pastrami sandwich on white bread . It was very skimpy on meat and what meat there was , was not very good . Every bite was gristle . I won ' t be back .
$ 75 for 50 small wings and didnt even come with cerlery and carrots . We will no go back
Pho broth was good but very disappointed in the very small amount of sliced beef that was in it . Will try again because it ' s close and local .
Bad service , sketchy people , bathroom out of order . Keep driving , even if you are pushing your car .
Bad customer service . They could not get simple order right . No bathroom , and the carpet are incredibly dirty . Bad seating .
Took an hr for them to bring my food , inconsistence food . This place is a waste of space in vegas , should have new management or new cook , whatever . Not coming back for sure .
It feels like sloths work here because it takes over 30 min to get through the drive thru . Beware : Avoid at all costs !
HA ! You missed a ride to the airport . You shoulda seen what these jokers did to my wedding night !
After 3 separate trips here , I have given up on this place . Just not very good french food . If you can ' t make a decent croque monsieur , you need to hang it up .
It ' s difficult to find food worse than what now Applebee ' s offer . Used to be great , but horrible now .
I went to Royal Buffet for lunch . The food was not that delicious , and it had small selection of food . The reason I gave two stars is really because I have better experience somewhere else .
Can ' t park in their lot to gamble as a new customer , sooooo you don ' t want this money ? Take your money elsewhere .
They re - open on Meadows ln and closed again ? ? Im upset . Dont know what happened to them or my store credit . This reallyyyyy sucks .
Dim sum was ok . Chung Funn was not good .
Small collection of Slot Machines and crappy pay outs . This casino used to be one of the better ones a long time ago but it has gone way down hill .
Not impressed with my experience at this clinic . NOT RECOMMENDED . There are better places in Toronto for hair removal or laser procedures . Spend your money elsewhere
Horrible customer service in the drive thru two times now . You ' d be embarrassed if you spoke to anyone like they do let alone it being a business .
Moved to Phoenix from the Midwest and was hoping to try some authentic Mexican food . This place was awful . I was so disappointed . . only thing I liked was the salsa .
Friendly service for sure , but there was one issue : I ordered two bottles of Stone Ruination at $ 8 each , and the " enjoy by " date was 10 months ago !
Ordered this in December and received a piece of cake with a November date . Just gross . I called and they said they freeze their cakes . I don ' t know . Just weirded me out .
They don ' t ever deserve a 1 , my nails look awful and the owner doesn ' t care , i ' d never recommend this place to no one .
This is the third time now that I ' ve had a greater than 10 min wait for food at this location . Terribly slow all the time . And was completely out of taco meat one time .
Never enjoyed the food here . The mango shake however is good . But thats not a good enough reason to go to a chinese restaurant , sorry !
The sushi was some of the best I ' ve had in town , however the service was AWFUL . Also , they do not have AYCE , but that doesn ' t affect my review .
Went to lunch buffet . Good service . Good price . Average food . Cold buffet plates . Not a huge selection and food needed to be 10 deg F warmer .
Went here with a friend for brunch . . . be sure to check your bill because they increased the price on our bills compared to the menu .
My orange chicken was dry like it had been sitting there for a while . My noodles were almost cold . Never going back . Yuck , I wish I had gone to firehouse subs instead .
The staff are all very friendly and they try hard . The fact is , the food is just not that good . It ' s airport bar food at best . I ' d avoid .
The food is a 7 / 10 but the service is really bad . Girl worker keeps staring at me and my friends while were eating for no apparent reason . Makes me feel uncomfortable .
Horrible service ! Took an hour and a half for two drinks and an appetizer . Makes me not want to go back ; very disappointing : (
Very bland and boring food . Definitely not a place I would come back to . Over priced as well .
So far in 50 / 50 , been twice ( 2015 / 16 ) great seats both times , great staff ! Id rate it higher but i caught a bug which hospitalized me for a week !
I got over charged $ 10 . 00 . Pay with cash or get robbed ! ! ! ! The outside patio is worst !
I used to love this place but lately it ' s disgusting I can ' t even eat my fries there so well done . The food quality has gone down so much very disappointed !
This racist and fascist rag is a sorry excuse for a newspaper . It ' s a crying shame that some people trust this for their news .
Very scary walked in and walked out ! Went to the rail instead !
WAY TOO MANY FLIES INSIDE . Disgusting . So distracted by them I couldn ' t say how the food was . A real shame , waste of a very charming place .
Are you a broke dirty thug ? Come to Tropicana and hang out with your friends !
Not up to the hype . Food taste and quality is not even average . Prepared to be disappointed .
Terrible delays ! ! ! As we speak I am on a 240 flight from Las Vegas that has not taken off yet ! My flight from Los Angeles was delayed as well ! ! Uhh !
Food was fine . Service was super slow . If you order chicken teriyaki it is only chicken . Nothing else . Period .
Nothing special at this sub shop compared to the competition ( Uncle Sam ' s , Blimpies , etc ) . The staff was friendly and the store was clean . Major parking problem at this location .
Food is always good at Dennys , though not to clean at this one . Hope the kitchen is clean .
The slowest & poorly run Einstein we have EVER seen . Got my order wrong THREE times and the place was dead . Go to the one across from UNLV , " F " this location .
Total clownshow . Service was awful , food incredibly overpriced . Only redeeming qualities were the sunset and the $ 2 . 50 Miller Lite cans .
Uhm my boyfriend bought a mattress from here and never got it . And now they ' re out of business . What exactly do we do now lol
Do NOT expect your catering order to be complete OR for them to deliver what they ' ve missed at all . . no apologies & the worst customer service .
If you want bed bugs this is the place to be . Worst feeling is waking up at midnight bitten by these critters
Can ' t even review because no one will . ANSWER the phone during THEIR listed business hours ! Called multiple times ; very gross and highly unprofessional !
I live next door and frequent here a lot . Love the chicken wings but the other food is always served cold . Sent food back a few times .
Tried to call to get info ; no answer and couldn ' t leave a VM because their mail box is full ! Not a good sign . . . .
Saw a sign for cheap drinks , figured a jeagerbomb before a concert wpuld be awesome . 8 bucks and I got a crappy plastics shot with jeaguer and a tiny splash of red bull . NOT satisfied .
The owner is extremely rude . He constantly is leaving out sandwiches in my pick up orders , and then denying it . Accusing me of lying . Food is great . Service is ATROCIOUS .
They don ' t even acknowledge you unless you have an appointment . Waited 30 minutes and wasn ' t even checked in .
All down hill . This place has so much potential but a huge lack of ownership . Disappointing to say the least
Horrible customer service . Was yelling at us when their credit card machine wouldn ' t work . The pastries looked kind of old and don ' t know how long they were sitting on the shelf for .
I never had pizza from this location before , I ordered a delivery to my friend house , pizza was saggy and cold and backed all the way I throw half of it away
This place is really fouled up , had an appointment , got there , waited for 15 min , and no one came out to Even talk to me , creeps ! ! Never again !
This place is a huge disappointment . You think you would get some class in Las Vegas . . . .
Just recently dined at Lupo at Mandalay Bay . Service was excellent bread and olive oil with olive paste great but pasta dishes were severly over cooked . Will never . go back .
If you ' re going to charge for ranch , it would be nice if you actually included it in the delivery more than 25 % of the time when it is ordered .
I wasn ' t too thrilled with trying this place as soon as I stepped inside . The place gives me the skivies . Food was ok nothing great .
Very nice people but the food was awful as But the pancakes were alright and they make to die for hot chocolate oh but maybe keep the restaurant cleaner
BEWARE ! Took my brand new 2013 Denali here for a simple in and out . Came out with the drivers window scratched inside . Management told me tough luck .
How about you play fucking rock & roll at your ' rock & roll ' establishment ? Maybe a tribute to Lemmy this week ? ? Wow . Sad .
Absolutely pitiful customer service . Ridiculously slow and zero apologies from their staff . I left without eating .
I didn ' t think the food was very good . Also it was overpriced . I wouldn ' t recommend ever going out of your way to eat here !
Advisement here sucks . Takes hours even when there ' s no one else in the waiting room . Smh have gotten up and left twice
Horrible ! ! ! Very unfriendly , not helpful , slow . They need better service . They took forever to help me turn in my passport application .
TSA was rude as can be . I thought Toledo was the armpit of America but it might actually be Cleveland .
I don ' t understand how people think this place is so good , it ' s frozen food deep fried cheap buffet food . It ' s not good at all we were done eating in 15 minutes
Everything in our order was wrong or forgotten . Next time I ' ll choose a different location .
Too pricey , not that tasty . $ 13 for a mediocre grille cheese sandwich , ok chips and a tiny bottle of coke . I may possibly go back but not any time soon .
worst indian food ever . order the chicken tikka which did not even look remotely like chicken . masada sauce was runny and had no flavor . never ever going back .
13 . 73 for a medium soup ! ! ! Go to Joel ' s or Patisserie cafe for the same it is under $ 8 for 32oz .
The worst breakfast I have ever had . We waited for over a hour & i had to send my eggs back because they were still liquid .
Since this paper supports Hillary Clinton , I ' m not giving them my business anymore . I would give zero star if I could .
The food is pretty tasty , my major complaint is with the price . Wife and I were out nearly $ 45 after tip for a single roll each and a single beer . Ouch .
Concept good , execution not so good . Tuna was fishy , beef was dry . . . won ' t be going back .
This place has gone down hill ! Food overcooked . Service poor ! Never again ! They need to work on customer service . Food should not come with inedible items in it !
The environment is clean and you can enjoy the meal in a cozy atmosphere！But the main dish is pretty small and taste is not that good as I thought . A quite expensive for eating full～
Decent . Trying too hard for what they are . They don ' t have Albertan beef , that brought it down a peg too .
Food is great once you get through the attitude of the employees . Countless mistakes on the orders . And it is FILTHY : the bathrooms , the dining area , the tables and so on .
This is the worse sushi I ' ve ever had . Grocery store sushi is better than this place . The honey bread smelt rotten , I just threw it away .
Went for lunch today . Had poor very slow service . I will not go back to this Panera . Seems to have gone down hill in the last six months .
The chicken tasted horrible . I seriously couldn ' t eat my chicken . . it was tasteless , and squishy . Just Gross ! ! Do not waste your $ $ here .
No no no . Avoid this place it ' s just well located otherwise food sucks !
Food is not worth the price or the wait . Not sure of the attraction - noisy , cramped quarters and EXPENSIVE . My husband and myself will not go again .
Extremely rude service . Food mediocre . I will not go on and on . Brought our out of town friends here . . . Very disappointing .
Very horrible quality in food I would not recommend them to anyone I don ' t see how there in business and it smells like cigaret smoke
I ask them a screwdriver for a minute even said i can pay for that . . . he said No ! Really bad guy ; (
Came in for breakfast , but the service is terrible here . Painfully slow . Every Time I come here its the same . Plus not many options for vegans or vegetarians .
The worst customer service ever ! Stuff is not even sure who is the manager and how to handle a simple situation . Will never go back ! ! ! !
food was mediocre , way too pricey , even for vegas . waiter and waitress was just as bad as they come . . . . never going again .
Really Egg Works ? I am so disappointed . This chunk of hair in my food is so huge , it seems it was put there intentional . There goes my favorite restaurant . Ugh !
Disgusting . Filthy . Beyond ghetto ! Carry hand sanitizer and make sure to check for airborne illness when you leave ! Eat elsewhere ! ! ! ! !
Unexpectedly poor experience given all the great reviews . Came in , ordered from the menu , then the kitchen took a very very long time with the food
This Panda has to have the slowest drive thru service in Arizona . They always seem to run out of food , especially during lunch and dinner rush times . No planning .
Don ' t let the good reviews fool you . This is a scetchy hotel . I was too afraid to stay here ! Had to pay for it anyway . Stay away ! !
Terrible . Overpriced . Ordered seafood hot pot and seafood was undercooked . Made me sick . Not coming back . Even Chicken wings were very bland . I really dont understand the hype .
Very bad food . . not clean , unhealthy , horrible taste . . I had to vomit everything I ate . . I am afraid it is not Halal also ! ! !
Food has gone down hill 83 is better and to much drama surrounding the place . You smell poo if you sit outside .
Excellent calamari and linguini but overpriced and with terrible service . Won ' t be back .
Long line waiting and only one cashier . After 25 minutes wait for five feet , I gave up . Mr . Chieu should hide some more help here !
This place is ghetto with a capital " G " . I recommend avoiding it if you can . I have nothing against Walmart , but this place needs to be closed .
Worst place to eat pupusas in las Vegas can ' t believe how bad their food is . . they are very cheap with the amount of filling they put in their pupusas
Poor service , first tattoo appointment soon be , if need to re - tattoo , the earliest six months later , poor attitude
Came for a friends wedding and woke up with bed bugs . Charged us anyways and threatened to call the cops .
They put an excessive amount of rice in my burrito and hardly any meat . I also noticed that the meat was very dry - like it had been sitting a long time .
No longer Pawn Daddy ! Went there Today all the Pawn Daddy People are no longer there .
Usually when you walk into a business like this you are greeted . I walked in and both girls sitting at the front desk were very unprofessional and straight out rude . Never again will I come here .
Waited over twenty minutes for four small steak tacos with barely anyone in the place . Lame
Don ' t waste your time . My drink had particles in it . The food was so cold , and the customer service sucked , they won ' t last long in business .
Very cheesy . Funny but not hilarious . My boyfriend is a huge evil dead fan and wasn ' t really impressed . Would have rather put the $ 100 on tickets towards something else .
This is my first time wash my car here , they clean the outside but not the interior detail , I am not satisfied with that .
After stopping in their restrooms , post coffee pickup , I won ' t be purchasing ANYTHING from here again . Cleanliness is not a priority in the bathroom , makes you wonder about the kitchen space .
Service at the counter was nice , but there are 2 employees taking up the WiFi counter watching employee training videos out loud without headphones and falling asleep , so that ' s not the greatest .
Store is never stocked . Always out of stock on items . The Walmart on Bell Road is much better . Always has what I need - all the time .
This is the worst Malaysian food I ever ate in my life . Very disappointed .
I paid for a VIP wash and they didn ' t wipe down anything . I would not recommend this place to anyone
The food here is like a worse version of Arby ' s . Waste of money !
This was a bad experience . Absolutely the most unhelpful person in a retail environment I ' ve ever experienced . Poorest attitude and exhibited absolutely no desire to even try to help .
Sushi is absolutely fine but the price is not . No lunch specials on weekends which means the only sushi set on menu ( with tempura ) is $ 16 .
Service was horrible . Had to ask several times for anything / everything . Food was a disappointment .
Disappointing , low quality fish . Only decent for the price if you want to eat high volume . I ordered an uni nigiri and the uni was off and brown . Do not recommend .
Was very rough with product overflowing on the floor . Pricing was very high and some toys priced more then when new . Not staffed well to complete needed customer service .
This place is awful ! They butchered my hair , then the hairdresser added an unauthorized $ 5 tip on to my debit card ( I had tipped cash ) . Talk about adding insult to injury .
Augies sucks effen nasty . . . White nachos how bout no . . . Pretzel Burger how bout eff no 10000 thumbs down . !
Way overpriced for their product , just drive by and find a much better pie for half the price .
Man this pizza taste just like the pizza at SAMS Club been sitting awhile and chewy . Glad I only got one slice .
If you don ' t want to lose your natural lashes , I would not recommend this . They tell you that you won ' t lose any but you DO ! !
DO not go to this clinic , they don ' t even have a real Doctor and they charge more that you supposed to pay , terrible service .
They take reservations but apparently it ' s up to the manager to make sure your party has seating or not . Worst service ever .
Food isn ' t that great and there are better places near by . The outside patio is nice but that ' s about it .
Welcoming atmosphere but didn ' t enjoy the sushi here that much ! I ' ve had better for way cheaper . First and last time here . I ' d rather go to Tempura Sushi Bar instead .
The guys who work here are absolute d * * kheads . They ' ll send you to another store just to get you out of the store . Don ' t waste your time .
Food was okay , but the service is terrible . I ' m not sure if it was the time of day we were there , but get it together !
The salad was good , the hamburger was caked in bleu cheese to an inedible fault . It ' s a no for me . . . . . a big no . : (
Great service at table . Very fast and courteous . Steak griller needs an attitude check or a new job as he was just plain rude to everyone .
This is the worst dim sum place I every eaten . Everytime I go to Great Wall my stomach hurts . There manner are the worst .
Got the worse food poisoning of my life here ! Seriously thought I was gonna die !
Updating my rating . This location is very poorly ran now . They are often out of white rice ( ? ? ) , let alone the rest of the food . Disappointed
Very rude staff had my small dog for over 5 hrs when we go get him he was shaking he was so nervous never had an experience like this before
The VIP area for St Paddy ' s day party was a bust for the price . Limited drinks and very limited food
1st time here had the Carne Asada Fries the were ok also tried strawberry cheese cake it was eh . Coffe supper strong . Would come back for the food
There Italian herb & cheese bread is ALWAYS so under cooked . It ' s not suppose to look like white bread with Orange lines
I ordered a simple mac salad to go , got home and tried it and it was too salty to the point of it being inedible .
Mocha good but not standing and waiting 10 minutes for it . Long lines , not enough help . Staff were friendly but long conversation with clients made a slow transition for guests . Poor process .
Horrible , my paint job on my full set is beyond messy . He had to take of polish once and restart . 0 stars
Dirty tables , dirty bathrooms , smells like dog inside . Overpriced fast food in questionable setting .
If you want to meet a rude cashier n staff go visit this place . food is very lame n tasteless .
Very delicious ice cold beer . . . Food was awful . Grilled chicken tasted like subways .
Food was good but not great . For the prices , the food should be amazing . However , they did have tasty pretzel bread . But def not planning to go back .
Never come back again . Food did not match the price . Didn ' t taste that good . And they cannot make roast duck bone soup .
This was our first experience at Edulis after hearing a lot of rave reviews . We were very disappointed with the March menu and sad to say we won ' t be returning .
Visited McDonald ' s for a McFlurry with my nieces , customer service was good but the dining area was nasty . Flies everywhere and tables dirty . Will not visit this spot again . . . gross .
Been here twice in the past year , each time the coffee drinks take way to long to make and they don ' t taste good . Ok at best . Go somewhere else if you care about flavor
Worst place to go in Toronto . Service is terrible , they should be barred from hospitality industry .
Wanted to purchase a Gift Certificate for a friend and have it mailed for her birthday . They just couldn ' t do t hat . Really ? ? ? ? ? Oh well there loss ! !
This Dibellas sucks monkey ass literally ! They can ' t comprehend your order correctly then have attitudes bc they fcked up ! Never again ! Ain ' t no starts bihhh
Sales agents do not listen and therefore cannot solve your problems . And Yelp said my review wasn ' t long enough so I would suggest driving to the Verizon store in Surprise on Bell .
Very very oily sushi . The maki were bad too . They were big , a lot of rice , but not a lot of fish : (
if boa ' s mission is to dissatisfy its costumers and make them wait forever , they have done a great job . Great modern building and Great waiting line
Horrible customer service . Was a loyal customer but the have really let the service slide . I will be finding a new threading salon .
Don ' t come here if you ' re black . My friend are owners and pay good money only for us to be harassed the entire night .
Why do you have the HOT light on when you don ' t have any glazed doughnuts . Also you don ' t close for another hour and a half so why is the machine off already .
Service is slow , food is always cold and dirty dining area as well as food prep area is always filthy
Oh yah , the service here defiantly is awful , they guy took my order for sure has attitude issue , super rude and super impatient , if he dislike his job he should quit .
A 27 min walk and wait just to utilize a provided amenity . . . s simple House Car . . . . ha 1 Car Per tower ! ! Haha What a Joke ! ! ! !
Lemon gross . Three out of four in our party felt unwell immediately after eating here . Food was expensive but poor quality . Much better Thai places in the city .
Worst McD ' s ever ! Will never return , person taking order in drive thru sounded high and slow as $ hit
Overpriced for what they offer and upon picking up the food the place definitely needed a thorough cleaning .
if i could give zero stars i would . microwaved food with bland to no flavor . bad customer service ! dont go here ever !
The food is fine . The people at the door , so - called hostesses , are rude . We had to complain to the manager . Will never return .
The staff was nice , but when I got my coffee the cup was just a little more than halfway full . That was pretty disappointing .
The food is ok . Not bad for a buffet . The staff is pretty unfriendly . I felt like I don ' t belong here . Definitely not coming back .
Terrible margaritas . . both mango and lime . Terrible service . Food was awful . I ' m surprised they are still competing in the Hudson foodie market .
Service was slow and inattentive . Potions were small . Prices are outrageous . Pass .
I went here for a birthday party on Saturday and there were two old drunk chicks fingerbanging on a couch . Classy joint !
I remember Cracker Barrel for having great home cooked food . Maybe it ' s what we ordered but it seemed like standard restaurant food . Great service !
I dont understand the big hype about this place - people waiting in line outside . The Food is nothing out of the ordinary , the portions are small for the price and the menu lacks variety .
This place sucks ! ! ! What concert venue doesn ' t let you tailgate . They oversell the lawn and the security guards are all on power trips ! ! !
Nothing to rave about . Bit overpriced on some items . Wait for food is longer than it should be , may be understaffed in kitchen on Painters Run .
i ' ve been here around three times and the food ' s good but the service is horrendous . it ' s also a little overpriced in my opinion
Very disappointed in thier lack of customer service . I called and left a message , a week later I am STILL waiting for a returned call .
Really , really poor service . Expensive food that is not worth the wait or the price . Not reflective at all of a 5 star resort .
Bad food , bad service . Food was very oily , bland and just not good . Will not return here !
This is my first time and last time ever I ordered a chessbuger and it was not cook all the way
Pretty rude . They don ' t respect their customers . Would never go back again .
We ordered the shrimp cocktail and it tastes like fake rubber shrimp . Do not waste your time at this place !
This place was old and dirty and only serves salmon with no other fish options . But you get what you pay for $ .
This place sucks the bartender slash manager pulled a glass of beer out of my cousins hand and pulled out mace and sprayed us for no reason that chick is nuts had to call police very unprofessional
Ridiculous prices for microscopic portions ; even with groupon it didn ' t make sense . Nothing tasted good . Random menu . Only one waiter and he was not attentive . It was an unpleasant experience .
I drove all the way the office and discovered you can only buy a carwash if the owner is there .
This food should not have left the kitchen . This was a $ 90 bill with Uber Eats delivery today !
This was before we found out The Palace Station was a better deal with buffets . Wont come back here since the food was trash .
Fun atmosphere . The food is simply not that great . And expensive even for Vegas . Would come back for the beer specials and live music but not for the food .
Had potato skins and hot wings . Food looked good but was average at best in taste and too expensive .
Probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had . And I have eaten at Taco Bell . Super low quality !
Edit . Nevermind . Don ' t bother unless you want to be rescheduled constantly and want the wrong length lashes on occasion .
I ' ve tried better places . . . the food is not great but its edible . I live Rivas Mexican Grill on Desert Inn better for the same price . I would not got back .
Really the credit machine is broken . Not good for a society moving towards being cashless .
You cannot eat with kids here and you cannot know that unless you drag them through the whole city to be told they cannot enter . + rude service
Came here for the early Black Friday Deals , they advertised heavy and only had a handful of TV ' s . Store manager nearly caused a riot , had to call in over a dozen police officers .
My wife and her bridesmaids had a rough experience here getting their dresses . Communication was lacking as well , with misinformation being given a few times .
do not go to there next location horrible un professional racst group they hold you when you go to shoot there guns an dont let you in if your brwn
Good concept . Weak product . Sandwiches are overpriced for quality and quantity . I will not recommend or revisit . Sorry Which Wich . Wish I could have been satisfied with your sandwiches .
The furniture we ordered was great but having to call to check on the order for 2 months when we kept getting told a new delivery date was annoying .
The worst ever , the ac doesn ' t work the restaurants are awful and it ' s way over priced . Can ' t sleep without ac
Gave my wife and I the poops . AMAZING service , food was pretty good . Called back and spoke with the manager , no result .
The best thing one can say about this place is that it was open . The bowl tastes like wet cardboard , the chicken is dry , the veggie selection is substandard . But , it was open .
way overpriced for the food , service was good , but not enough optional for how blan the dishes both look , and are prepared . dissatisfied .
Sitting here for over five minutes watching cars behind me get their orders while I wait for a simple bacon egg and cheese bagel . This is ridiculous ! I will never be back ! !
This place is over rated ! Can ' t figure why I paid $ 9 . 44 for a bowl of soup with a bun . Never coming back again .
Wrong Mexican food I ' ve ever had in Phoenix ! The service was horrible and to top it off . . there was an awful smell . Not authentic at ALL !
Out of all the stadiums in Arizona , this is clearly the worst . Poorly designed and overselling games
This place is in a good location , directly left of the stage in the back of the park . So live entertainment , great fries but poor Customer service .
The worst urgent care , all they do is gossip , the doctor too . I don ' t even know why this is call a specialist . Doctors don ' t know anything ! ! !
The lines to check in are atrocious . The room that I was put in had the furniture all chipped . I tried to upgrade room and have to stand in line again which is taking 45 min
Walking distance from my work however I will never make that journey again . The burger meat was so small you could call it vegetarian . There was a cute girl there but she was not vey nice .
setup is so awkward . service is o - - - - - kay . . i guess food is not the best . .
The food took a really long time to come out and tasted very refrigerated . It wasn ' t the bar food level . The drink were just , ok .
I went here after reading the positive reviews on yelp , if you are willing to compromise quality for time , then go to Stitch it , otherwise go to other boutique tailors , Yelp hides negative reviews btw
yah , chain pizza in an airport , what could you expect ? i think i paid $ 5 for one of the worst slices of pizza i have ever had . and i ate the whole thing .
Mediocre food quality . Long busy lineups . Sushi is below par . Crab is bad and shrimp is barely eatable . Wok grill was good and deserts had lots of variety . I would not go again .
Customer service was poor in this place and chick that works there wouldn ' t even hardly let us into the restroom even though we were there too order food bad attitudes and no smiles
Ordered my food through the drive thru came all the way home just to find a bug inside my food ! This is disgusting ! Will never be eating there again !
Gone way down hill with service since losing the Hilton tag . Very poor . Employees were not happy
i ask for a burger the waitress ask how you want that done i said well done not burnt it came barely cooked
I made appt over the phone . Guess what the overbooked . Ben put me with this tech that was terrible . They take advantage of locals . Very greedy people .
Ordered the Cod Fillets , very greasy and soaked in oil . Could not eat this and won ' t ever go back !
Horrible college ! If you can go somewhere else they are so unorganized and try to find ways to make you attend their school .
Terribly bland . My pumpkin curry was weak as water and filled with frozen peas and carrots . The steamed dumplings were good . The rest of the meal was rubbish .
Recently closed permanently . http : / / experiencethepub . com / rocky - river / news # / 08 / 07 / 2011 / pub - rocky - river - statement
Customer service is terrible . I have had issues the last 3 times I ' ve taken my car and I will not be returning .
Terrible experience at this location . Doctor Nyguen was terrible . My recommendation to anyone is avoid this place .
Terrible sandwich . Stale bread , dry sandwich , no flavor . Cashier was grumpy with a bad attitude .
So slow ! This is the worst Dunkin ' Donuts anywhere . How hard is coffee ? The management needs to get it together !
Wow now I remember why its been six months since I went to McDonald ' s we good to see this brand die .
This review is directed to kitchen and food . Please do not waste your money on a lunch or dinner here . Thee kitchen will serve you expired food .
To much sugar in the sauce . very sweet , the dough is rubbery . . they need to go to NYC and taste the real stuff .
Slowest drive thru ever ! I hardly come to this location but when i do , makes u irritated because of how slow they are .
The Food Is TERRIBLE ! ! Doesn ' t Seem Like Restaurant Food @ All , But U Will Pay Restaurant Prices ! ! Do Not Come Here If U Want a Good Meal ! !
Filibertos a d Taco Bell are WAY better ! Del Taco ( in my opinion ) is amingst the weakest ( if not the weakest ) of fast food Mexican . Just sayin !
We have been here for over 40 minutes and our food order has yet to arrive . If your hungry find another place in Tempe marketplace .
BBQ . . . and especially the ribs were just so so . Beers were definitely good to balance it out . Atmosphere was above average , but if going for food . They need some help here .
Not the best burrito . The tortilla shell wasn ' t fresh , and the corn taste like it had been sitting for a while . The dairy products and sauce were fresh
The cashier took way to long to place my order and my friend got charged too much for what she ordered .
McRib is Back ! Served as a meal with a generous portion of succulent irresistible COLD A # % FRENCH FRIES ! ? ? WTH ? ?
Not good for early morning travelers . Just bad all around . No one cares . Services open late and close early .
Check in took forever , the pool was small , the restaurant food was mediocre and overpriced .
Came here with an open mind despite mediocre reviews . However its basically a bad Chipotle knock off .
The service is quick for a to go order but the strangest thing happens . I got charged a service charge . Why is it a service charge for a to go order ?
Ordered a signature bowl . I was given very little quantity and not that good in terms of taste . Definitely not worth the wait , I suggest going else where for lunch .
Portions are a little small . My steak was under cooked . Service was good , but they try to fill you up on peanuts and bread
Worse cocktail service in slots area . They are giving Aliente a run for the money at being bad .
Donna K ummmmm more like Donna No , When FLOYD left he took the good food with him . The food is not that great hate to say it but its true
Me and my wife ordered steamed white bass & scallops dishes . Both dishes are just bitter , no taste and way over priced . It was unbelievable we spent $ for this crap .
The food made me sick , and their restrooms weren ' t clean . . . I don ' t know if the combination was what made me sick or not
Worst christmas eve dinner ever . Teriyaki chicken horrible . Then when i brought it back they woyld not give me a refund . Steer clear of this restaurant no customer service .
Seeing how the manager didnt even come out to see how a party of 18 is doing should be criminal .
Zero stars is right . Had my Ipod taken out of my center console when I paid $ 200 for a detail service . Terrible customer service , they don ' t care about theft .
The server stepped on my foot while we were waiting to be seated . She acted as if she didn ' t feel anything . No apology at all !
Rice in the sushi was overcooked , or it was probably left overnight . The quality of this place is getting worse and worse . Don ' t bother getting sushi from this place . Overprice .
My delivery finally arrived after more than two hours . It was cold , and they got the order size wrong .
Sub was delicious staff was super rude !
Terrible service at this location . Had a billing issue and per the manager " nothing I can do about it " . Many other pizza shops to chose from , don ' t chose this one .
First time and the last time I will have a waffle with anything but a waffle . Game day service was just ok . I would come back for a $ 5 beer and that ' s it .
Lady doesn ' t speak English and couldn ' t give me an answer to a simple question . . " how much to have a battery installed in my watch ? "
We reserved the table on their website and got the confirmation . Upon arrival , we were told there was a private function and we got kicked out . . .
No longer offers day pass to locals for pool and spa use : ( bad call Southpoint , HELLO SILVERTON ! !
I went there today and got a pedicure I asked the lady for a design which is 5 $ more she put 2 lines and 1 rhinestone on my toe I wasn ' t happy at all .
Sales people are misleading and are dishonest . General manager unconcerned about customer satisfaction . Will not recommended this dealership to anyone . Took advantage of this senior citizen .
Absolutely love this spa ! Very chic and relaxing . Best massage I ' ve ever had . The staff was super friendly . Can ' t wait to end my next Vegas weekend there again ! !
They has too much oil in their food . Cocktails were worse . Too pricy . Never coming back here . Even the service was below average .
Waste of time they didn ' t even open the window after I ordered and everyone is just looking at me who ' s working drive thru
Terribly slow service ! ! ! 20 minute wait for box of Joe and dozen donuts . Only 2 customers ! ! ! Seriously ? ! ? !
Saturday at 5 : 00 pm . I count yen tables empty and not seating . Interesting ? Hopefully you will spend time in the bar ?
Food is absolute garbage . Came out stale and cold . A completely unsuccessful rip - off of Pete ' s .
Quality and hospitality went down the drain . Subsequently , I ' m removing my 5 star review and photos .
food is always cold and undercooked . staff is less than friendly & lack quality control of orders
I feel the quality had really gone downhill with the competition of Craft Burger and Gourmet Burger which are superior
Went here for breakfast . Not sure what was worse , the meal or the service .
While our food was cold on delivery , the staff were eating breakfast in front of guest . Management did come to apologize , but really ?
Outdated . Rooms are not too bad but tv channel lineup is nowhere to be found . And there is like 4 channels that come in . Paper thin walls as well . Stay somewhere else .
You know a store is over priced when it costs you $ 2 + for a CAN of pop !
Worst dealership ever lying crooks STAY AWAY STAY AWAY
We had Jardin Tuesday night about 14 of us . Almost everyone hated the food along with a list of other issues , luckily we have dogs to feed leftovers . Highly not recommend !
Horrible service . . . waited around for 20 mins and since I needed to return something couldn ' t have any assistance . Ridiculous !
Everything tastes the same . . And not good . Probably they have pre cooked . There are way better options close by
Food is yummy but wait is forever for the food . We ordered the omelette with pancake and fruit combo . Pancake and fruits never came but our bill did . The server ask if we wanted something .
Maybe the college crowd likes sub standard food because of the lack luster drinks but for $ 25 this lunch was comparable to the quality of Taco Bell ! Not impressed at all : (
I have been trying for a month to get into dash pass and it will not go through by text , phone or online . Any ideas ? ?
good burger . friendly staff . prices are about 3 times that of in n ' out . glad i tried it . will never go back . sisimply way overpriced .
Awful watered down curry with no flavor and bland . No filling in the paraths . It seemed like the food was reheated . Would never go back
Poor experience and terrible service . Waiter was rude and gave extremely lackluster service . They a get two stars bcs the music was good .
Sucks it ' s like food from a high school cafeteria ! Actually my high school was better . Don ' t recommend
The food was awesome , my boy and I got the prime rib and short rib , but our waiter was a dumbass . Guy never came by to grate
My kid and I got food poisoning here . No compensation . Stars because games were fun here .
Seems like a decent park . . . bathrooms are seriously disgusting and they need more trash cans down near the fields .
Horrible experience ! Our server had a nasty attitude that she definitely needs to change . She was very snarky and extremely rude . Completely ruined my appetite . Will not be coming back again .
Wednesday Lobster special was rubbery & over cooked . Very disappointing . Not impressed whatsoever : - (
This was the worst Mexican restaurant I ' ve ever eaten at . I ordered the enchiladas and the corn tortillas were hard and no flavor . Everything was cold . . I will never come back . .
Slooooow service . Food was cold when I got it . Staff is friendly enough , they just need more staff on for the Friday rush .
My screen failed within 1 month of getting it repaired , total grey screen of death . I have to get a new phone now .
The portions are small , taste was average , and the price was expensive . Tasted better in downtown for way less the cost . 4 people cost over $ 150 and we left hungry !
Stole my money ! Charged me for delivery and never delivered ! still trying to get my money back !
Terrible food . Terrible food . Terribleeeeee fooooood . Went here for a wedding reception and it may have been the worst food I have ever tasted . . . .
bad food，roach，i saw them in the floor，i couldnot think the kitch is，omg，we eat the roach，donnot go there to eat the roach！
Food good , atmosphere better , after an easy 15 times here the service is so bad I may not be back again . Unfriendly , slow , borderline rude
Service is great but food is nothing special . Also didn ' t want to make a big deal , but there was a piece of hair in my soup which turned me off the entire stay .
The lady in the front attitude is extremely horrible ! I ' ve never seen people act that way !
Non - smoking rooms don ' t really exist , older facilities and staff . . . meh . Never again .
This location is not a true Johnny Rockets food suck you get better food at McDonald ' s Food suck so much I ' m angered for spending $ 28 for this quality
Owner contacted me , was abusive , said my comment was ignorant . Totally solidifies my statement of unprofessional , way to cement a 1star review sir .
" Meh " pretty much says it all . And not even a cheap " meh " at that . Kinda cool atmosphere , high prices , unexceptional food and passable service . Why bother ?
Horrible . Very dirty . . . . just doesn ' t seem like I was in Vegas . Here is the glasses when me and wife opened cabinet .
Best part was the fries which I rarely eat . Shawarma was overdone - too crispy & very few ingredients . Beef samosas - beef was good but about a teaspoon in a very bready wrap .
The food may be good but it ' s not worth the abusive treatment by the woman placing our order . Sorry we wanted to spend our money here - won ' t happen again .
Not the best pizza in town as they advertise . Tasted more like school lunch pizza to the hubby and me . The chicken tasted like it had freezer burn . Won ' t be back
Too bad the bartenders are total assholes here because their pozole is so fucking good .
The food is delicious but the service is terrible . Just beware when you go in you will have a rude cashier who doesn ' t care about doing his job .
My first and last visit . Beer selection marginal . Shepard ' s pie was obviously frozen and microwaved . Center was cold and greasy
Was looking for failing grades on the health district maps today , Pei Wei was on it . http : / / www . reviewjournal . com / restaurant - inspection - guide
Service was slow and it wasn ' t busy when I was there . The shawarma sandwich was below average and was very messy to eat . I do not recommend .
Wait time was terrible ! When we did get our food the eggs were cold . Waitress was nice , I know not her fault for the cooking time .
The food at the buffet was cold . We spoke to the staff about it but they seemed helpless . Not going back .
I went with my two younger daughters and the service was not great . There is a min order and they never let us know at reception . Food is not that great either . Kind of disappointed
Run down hotel with poor customer service . Elevators are slow and food is weak . Operator slow to pick up phone and manager does not call you back . STAY AT OTHER HOTELS !
Portions are small , sides are flavorless , and the BBQ itself is very average .
The women here are so rude so so so so rude I ' ve gone there multiple times and even the old ladies are rude WHAT EVER YOU DO AVOID THIS SALLYS
The Chico Malo website said they are open until 10 pm , the restaurant closed at 9 . Came recommended by our hotel .
Don ' t use the Flamingo valet . . . just now noticed new shoes missing from my car . So unfortunate . . . gotta love thieves !
This place SUCKS , they use parts and was paid for NEW parts . Don ' t go there , This is your only warning .
There should be more valet . . . They haven ' t quite taken over all the convenient parking for other customers .
Endroit super snob avec un très mauvais service . Le tartare de saumon était fade et même le Bloody Caesar était raté ! Je n ' y retournerai plus jamais .
I disagree with the previous comment about insurance sales . Avis rental car office at YYC airport is overpriced , aggressive in selling insurance , and bad in customer service . The manager was rude .
Slow ass service . They also suck at greeting too . Get more employees and a manager who cares .
The cookies are good , but not nearly worth the money . Why would I buy a three dollar cookie when I can get a whole roll of cookie dough for less than that at the store ?
Slow service . I got my wrong order . Our bottomless mimosas were soo slow . Though I have to say the food was good .
An emergency for them is when u got shot or killed so they can address ur call , otherwise be ready to wait an hour or so . Have ur gun loaded ! ! ! Only in vegas .
Came here for summerlicious , cute small restaurant . Food however was just average , and the salad was fairly bland .
This place was horrible ! I paid 200 dollars for dinner for two , my steak was still mooing ! If you are in Vegas and want a real steak , Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse does it right !
Home plate ! ! You would think put on a baseball playoff game before football . NOPE ! ! Better off renaming this place Inn Zone !
Beware of security letting punks steal phones and shoes here . A group of kids got their phone and shoes stolen from cubbies and security had them on surveillance and did nothing .
The worst service ever . Cold food and they combined two separate orders in one large container and acted like they did me a favor . Super uncool !
The service staff had their dreadlocks dipping into my plate of racks . You also can ' t get basic ground beef tacos here . The staff is ignorant and duty !
I normally don ' t write too many reviews but this place was terrible ! The food had no taste , the vegetables were so bitter to the point my fiancée and I couldn ' t eat it .
there is no customer service at this cafe at all ! ! drinks and desserts are soso . not worth to come ! !
I never come back here . They don ' t display about the contract and they get my money on my debit card
Food was horrible . The pizza was bland and sparse toppings . Garlic cheese bread had zero garlic and bread was soggy .
Service was horrible , food was terrible The spaghetti was drawn in water Burger was burnt Don ' t recommend
Every time I have a sausage from there I feel sick to my stomach only this location . Super dirty and slow . Worst McDonald ' s in the gta . Possible
The food is fine , but by far the slowest service of any Chipotle I have ever been to . Every time I think the service couldn ' t be worse a new bar is set .
Large portions , great ambiance , but the food seemed to lack flavor . Maybe they have changed their recipes , but I thought it used to taste a lot better .
Worst customer service ! The older lady at the cash register acts annoyed when she takes your order and doesn ' t seem to want to even take the order .
If you ' re looking for something Latin authentic this is not it . I paid 14 for my meal and it was not worth it . Definitely not coming here again .
Worst car wash company , can ' t clean with dirty towels . They always leave streaks and dirt on my cars . Will never go back
Terrible customer service , shitty selection , poorly managed , and just an overall uninviting store to have at the Quarter .
This is one of the worst resturants in Champaign , the service is bad , the food is microwaved and tasteless .
Super slow ! Do not come here if you value your time ! ! And my food was cold ! Unacceptable ! ! !
Closed store early after driving 30 minutes out of the way to give them a $ 100 sale . unapologetic and unprofessional when bringing it to their attention .
The slowest and likely the worst fast food restaurant in the world . When you are stuck at the McCarran airport , do yourself a favor and avoid this place .
I went there for dinner . The food was ok , nothing spectacular . The food was neither fresh not authentic . There are places serving much better Indian food in the city .
Great pizza ! No ice for my bourbon and it ' s 25 a pour Waiter never came back after food was served !
Karen . It ' s Jeff and Courtney . If you see this reviews can you please email us . We really need to communicate and find a way to get our photos .
The service sucks here , my drink is so strong and my friends steak is terrible . An hour waiting for her steak ! And it ' s disgusting ! Wtf hire new people .
i ate there one time . i was not impressed . and because i livr behind it i am ticked off that it is so noisy . they need to oil the crap on thier roof . noiay .
Actually zero stars . Went last night . They are closed down and there is no notice on their website , had to get refund for our coupon .
Biggest rip off ever ! Nothing is special with their food . They are trying too hard , having waitresses describe your food with italian accent is not enough ! Showbusiness . . .
Taco Bell ' s line was really long so I decided to give Del Taco a try . 7 hours later ( 3 : 30 am ) I woke up feeling clammy and sick .
God awful , was way better under Caesar management . Do not waste your time or money .
I ' ve never had a bad experience at chick fil a but I literally had the rudest cashier she didn ' t thank me for my business . Drive through needs a little help
Waffles are good . . . Service slow . One person working , very slow and inefficient . Waited 30 min for my waffle .
Regarding their Custom Framing . I can ' t believe it took them 2 full weeks to finish framing my picture . Either they have alot of work or they work slowly .
It ' s hard to support local when it takes so bloody long for a coffee . Better taste than Starbucks but Slow and Wasting too much time conversing with customers ahead in the line .
I couldn ' t wait for this Bush ' s to open and ended up being very disappointed . Chicken tasted old , and the ordering system was a little odd . Won ' t be going back .
This place seem a lot dirtier then I remember food wasnt as good I wont be back
Food was decent at best . . . if you can get over all the flies its good . If not , order carryout . . .
Warning : They now charge 50¢ for using your credit / debit card . Won ' t be back .
A big resounding " meh " . I ordered the grilled pear sandwich which had two end - slices of uncooked pear with some cheese .
Not coming back . Unappreciative ( not saying thank you ) , energy just not good . There are too many other places to have to deal with the bad , again .
This one is not quite as good as Dominos normally is . The pizza tasted like the dough was old and had a cleaning chemical taste to it . Definitely a last resort for pizza .
Do not waste your time or energy going to this place . The office requires a 30 min prior appointment check in time then you wait 2 hours to be seen . Unprofessional staff .
Food is decent but the portions for the price is ridiculous . They upcharge for everything . There are other places that sell authentic cuisine for a cheaper price .
The worst popeyes experience ever . Left over chicken and stale . Worst poutine , everything was cold .
Service was friendly but my Caesar salad had ranch sauce on it instead and my pancakes tasted like they were made from no - name ingredients
This is a rip . I paid them for 6 months for a post office box rental I have the key and got no forwarded mail . Any helpers please help Linda L
Horrible always gives me old coffee ! ! ! Dont wast you time and money at this location ! ! !
The food was absolutely Luke warm . And terrible service . We were even served by the manager who only checked on our table once . This was ultimately a terrible decision to eat here .
Food was bland . I added 3 packets of soy sauce to my food . The egg roll was spoiled . Felt nauseous immediately after eating it . Would not recommend . Avoid at all costs .
Had the prime rib , terrible the baked potato was great . I ' m not sure what animal the prime rib came from probably not cow . I ' d stick to zingers if I come back
To start , the drive thru took way too long for my order . Not only did I have to repeat it several times it still ended up being wrong .
Always late on orders . . . so many people walked out today . Missed out on so much money . . poor business . Every cook jokes around never serious about their job very sad
The bartenders here are extremely rude every time I have gone in . Cheap drinks but terrible service .
Place sucks dont come here . I get here wait 20 min in line to open . I want to like this place but not when i feel ima get shanked when i walk by .
Waited an hour for my car to be washed . Horrible service . Manager seemed more interested in getting to his tee time than dealing with customers . An absolute joke and waste of time and money .
Overpriced . can get what we got anywhere . No seasoning . bad menu . Pathetic slice of prime rib . Might be good for catering but not dining . Amateurs .
Tried scheduling a dinner for a group of people . James the manager said he had another call coming in an hung up on me . With this kind of service I will not bring my group !
The food was amazing like it always is but your host name Tanya with an employee number 86 has a horrible attitude and really upset my wife after having an amazing night at the red rock casino .
They are very rude . Terrible , terrible customer service . Small hole in the wall & every last worker walks around with an attitude . Very bad energy & vibe here . DONT GO ! ! !
Service was great but the 22 Oz bone in ribeye was very disappointing . Mainly fat and bone . Where ' s the Beef ? Taking a break from Outback .
These folks need to hire some more phone help . Have called them 3 times in the last week . Minimum of 20 minutes on hold each time .
I have NO idea how on earth it stays open . The only thing it has going for it is the location on the Fountain . . . and that is it .
Food was ok . Service was terrible . If don ' t want to be asked for a second drink and want everyone ' s food to come out at different times , then give it a try
First time ordering . Pizza was barely warm and we are 5 minutes away barely . Ordered thin crust . A little dry and could use more cheese . Will not order again .
Please people if you are looking for a " fast food " to eat do not go to this place . 15 minute for a simple double cheese burger . Employees work slower then my grandma .
I came and got a set of acrylics on Tuesday and on Friday one nail popped off already .
Cold and depressing . I ' ve been to a few casinos around the country , and this is by far the worst . Save your money and avoid at all costs .
Really slow service . Delivery and pick up . My pizza looked like the workers cut out pieces for lunch and just lined it back up so it wasn ' t noticable .
Terrible ! Last time I got food from here , it was good . But it was also a long time ago . This time , both rolls were gross ! And the sushi was just edible .
Normally we live this place . We just finished and all our burgers were way over cooked and missing things we asked for .
This review is for delivery . Pizza was not satisfying , and pasta entree was a very small portion - - only 7 dumplings . Don ' t waste your money . Overpriced and underwhelming food .
Crust is like a thin deep dish , but if you don ' t like your pizza with an extra helping of grease don ' t eat here . This place is for desperately hungry tourists .
Service was slow and the vegetarian option was quite horrible . I would recommend trying one of the many other options in the area .
The food is good . However , watch your bill . They do not share the cost and you may end paying double , especially during restaurant week .
I got very mild food poisoning and would not recommend this place to anyone who values eating burritos in the future . Extremely plain meal .
Annoyed that the very day their new add comes out , I go to the store for 2 items and they have neither . Nice planning , Officemax .
No need to get defensive , just gave an honest review on my experience . Never coming back , don ' t want a refund .
This place was very bad customer service . The lady name Van was very rude and also had a terrible attitude . I would never recommend anyone to go there but only to get a haircut .
Terrible food , all the food on the buffet was dry old and most gone and scraps left stay away
Automatic $ 3 charge per person even if you don ' t drink tea . $ 30 for a bowl of ok noodles .
The food and ambiance were good . The service was lacklustre , absent and inconsistent .
New York Vibe and that includes the attitude of the staff . Pizza is good but the employees come off irritated and rude .
If you need some brass knuckles , a switchblade , or you are under age and need some tobacco or sheesh , hit this place up .
Pretty sure the chef doesn ' t know how to make Indo - Chinese food . We ordered the Gobi Manchurian and the Paneer Chilly entree , and all we got was some concoction heavy on tomato ketchup .
I had the gyro , not much meat , pita not grilled or toasted . Nothing special . Good service . Nice diner style surroundings
No nos gustó por qué no le pusieron mucho nitrógeno y era lo que esperábamos , muy mal
He must charge for his good looks because he ' s super expensive . Over 400 . 00 to install 2 cieling fans . . no thanks .
Eh . This place isn ' t worth the hassle . The sauce is good but everything else is pretty blah . No better than frozen pizza from the supermarket . The breadsticks were terrible . Tasteless .
Was one of the dirtiest stores I ' d ever been in . . . . the produce was awful . . . . people here seem to think dirty is good
This place is clean and serves great drinks , food is a bit to be desired , no flavor . Staff had to be flaggd down even at the bar directly .
Bad service up front - do not bring any young children here . Better off at Strip Steak
Lots of workers , but no one to help you ! Food - only thing that was hot was my coffee . Disappointed . Coffee was good !
This is the least well run operation in all of Sonic ' s stores ! they lie , they play with customers shakes they do not observe health regulations for food handling . DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION !
I went to inquire to this vocational school a few times because I was trying to get in to their LPN program . Only Luisa was helpful and the rest are very unprofessional . . .
The tacos were OK . The guacamole and the chips both had a lime salt on them that was horrible . Two stars is generous , probably won ' t be back
Took them half hour to get me pollo loco n las Vegas rolls . The couple that arrived after me received there food first . I did not appreciate it at all !
35 for 55 yelp but when you get there the price shoots up to 89 while they quote you 59 . . . Are you scamming people ?
Extremely unsatisfied with the food from this bojangles . The chicken tenders were way undercooked and my boyfriend got sick ! ! ! They also gave us regular fries instead of seasoned fries
Take an uber up central to Wild Thaiger . Or go anywhere else in walking distance . Poor service , zero atmosphere and sub par food . My wife said there is no soul in here .
No hot water one day , no coffee maker in the room , gave us 2 keys , at 2 different times that did not work . Not the friendliest employees
Our dinner was pretty bland . The brisket tasted boiled . Meh ! The corn bread was great !
Not accepting credit cards and screwing ppl by charging tax on milk .
Prices are getting way too high above what is listed on yelp . I had to cancel my order when they told me $ 18 for a medium white pie .
The horrible service here ruins the food ! Don ' t waste your time coming here to be ignored and treated rudely . They definitely need better , more experienced waitresses and kitchen staff .
Beautiful grounds . Friendly staff . Average beds . Uncomfortable bedding and FLAT pillows resulting in terrible sleep . I expect more from such an expensive and beautiful hotel .
My card was charged inexplicably and the phone number listed doesn ' t work . Hard to get a hold of anyone to get help .
OUT OF BUSINESS . CLOSED . FINITO . Not a big surprise . Where will all the pseudo N Scottsdale bikers go now ?
Pizza ' s OK but don ' t order Fish & Chips , can buy better at Safeway . Really the worst I ' ve ever had at a restaurant . . . ever !
when there today before a movie the service was very bad we had a bad salad and soup was cold taste old
Not enough swear words in the world will justify what I feel towards the service at this place . And next time I ask to see the manager , I ' m looking for him / her myself .
Guess you can ' t special order a " bento " box till they sell out of the ones they have . That cost you guys 35 dollars from that dumb ass rule .
Got the all you can eat way too overpriced for 24 . 99 , sushi variety low no hand rolls , or sashimi variety with basic rolls . Come for the specials , but sushi all taste the same
Very unprofessional and unethical . Carl and his wife have lied several times to my husband and I throughout our professional relationship with them . They do not return money owed in a timely manner .
By far the worst customer experience I have had at a Popeyes . The staff is extremely rude and unhelpful . Try to avoid this place if you can .
No longer Habeebe ' s . Now it ' s Schwarma guys . . . had a winning formula but now it ' s meh . Bring back to old Habeebes
I ' m absolutely disgusted , blatant disregard for tenants ' well - being . The management here needs to wake up and smell the roses !
Fruits et légumes à bon prix . Personnel mal élevé , méprisant ( du genre parler très fort au téléphone en servant les clients et faire fi de ceux - ci ) . Aucun bonjour ni merci ,
Worst Quiznos . . . employees are not interested in their product .
You get what you pay for I guess ! Great prices but service lacks in the friendly dept
The worst location in AZ . Rude people working the drive thru and always get brown lettuce on sandwiches . Won ' t be returning to this location .
The meat quality was exceptionally poor , as I could barely swallow the meat . The service was painfully slow as well .
Gross food ! 80 ' s decor . Why are people eating at this place ? ! ?
The food was good and the people were nice but the service was slow . It was a good thing we were not hungry as it took 40min to get our food .
We drove 30 minutes to this store to get some hiking boots and arrived 15 minutes before closing only to find that the store closed early for no reason . Very disappointed . I would avoid this store .
Pho noodles here are soggy . I ' m guessing that the cook isn ' t washing the noodles with cold water after they are boiled . Also the spring rolls were not so great either .
Been here a few times , it ' s a different taste of Middle Eastern , not the greatest but not the worst either .
Overpriced and not great . I paid over $ 100 for a full set and pedicure . The nails were so bad I paid another salon to redo them the next week .
I was in Phoenix for business last month and stopped by . The place smells terrible and the floors were sticky . Food was average . I would not recommend it .
No coffee shop in this station , have to drive down a bit to get to Tim Hortons . Small conveinence desk
We waited 35 minutes to receive our drinks , and we ordered crab dip with toast - it tasted like tuna casserole . Not impressed at all .
The National Bank at 2 Orchard Heights Drive in Aurora was closed more than two years ago .
Had the brisket . . . . . . . . . . . way too salty . May give it another try if I can stop drinking water from all the salt . Ick .
Vegetarian pad Thai with tofu is not good at all . . I ' d suggest going to Sukothai . Server was nice but it was hard to communicate with her .
Lame food , drink , and service . Not Tod English anymore . To top it off oysters were bad , " spit out of mouth bad " . Will not be back again .
I wish they had negative 5 stars here . They are rude as hitler here . go get a hot dog next door .
I will never go to this place again . So dirty . The food was horrible . We got sick afterwards . The bathrooms were disgusting . The heath department needs to pay them a visit .
How dare they not put cheese on my croissan ' wich ?
Not happy about the management in Galleria . The apt is good but the rest is not
service is ok . food is ok . . . actually really bland and plain . I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast . chamomile tea is the best . good luck .
Horrible customer service Seems like they don ' t want to be at work ? Awkward environment Rude employees COLD FOOD waste of money Stay away from this location
Thank goodness this is not my hometown as this restaurant is very slow and inefficient . Avoid if possible
Beautiful decor , but the food was disappointing ( bland , not special ) and the acoustics were terrible . At a table of six , we had to shout to hear each other .
How about paying attention toy when you have customers . Rang the door twice not even a just a minute I guess you don ' t need the clientele
Really bad service , and rude staff . The one at don mills is much better . Dont waste your time here .
They raise their prices a lot at a time , you can get better buy ' s on vitamins else where .
Slow slow slow slow slow , maybe the slowest FEDEX in the entire United States ! ! ! The only FedEx I have ever seen that charges you a handling fee to take your package .
I had a really bad experience here . I won ' t elaborate , but you can find a better rental car agency in the Pittsburgh Airport . I used Alamo once before and they were wonderful .
The chicken strips looked like the chickens they came from were anorexic ! All batter NO MEAT ! Not to mention they upset my stomach !
Worst service ever - empty bar had to beg for a drink and got attitude from waitress about wanting another drink , she will get to us when she can . Ok , will never come back ever
We bought a deal from RJ Deals for the Halloween Spooktacular Hayride . Do Not waste your time or your money ! I wish I would have checked this site before I purchased anything from these unorganized Hoosiers
This place has gone so far downhill . $ 20 for a pathetic wash , left garbage in the door pockets , didn ' t seem to give a rip . Never again .
Wings late , told that more blue cheese would be $ 1 , wing warm not hot , got ranch not blue cheese . This was at the bar not the restaurant . Highly do not recommend .
Absolut unfreundliches Personal . Würde das Restaurant nie wieder besuchen . Nachdem wir bezahlt haben , haben sie sich über das von uns zu wenig gegebene Trinkgeld beschwert . Mir persönlich hat das Essen nicht geschmeckt .
my lamb was so overcooked and gross , rice was good , potatoes were dry and horrible
Uhh I don ' t know what to write because the food was delicious and the waiter was kind but the service was really sloooooooooooooooooooioooooow
Disappointed to find out they use artificial flavoring in their ice cream . Thats not what homemade from old recipes means to me . Fake chemical flavors are NOT good .
Worst ever in every way except the technician was a nice guy but didn ' t do much . Not recommending to anyone . They were sent by Samsung . I had no choice . Nothing was fixed .
The pasta ' s are ok . We tried the gnocchi which is chewy . The food is overall bland ! The customer service is ok too !
Terrible . Don ' t bother . Does not compare to the former amazing Society Cafe . : ( . Plastic cups to bring your wine to go ? ? Fake flowers . So cheesy .
The lady behind the counters name was patience she was extremely grumpy and irritated for no reason at all . I ' ll go to another Starbucks I think : (
This place is closed . They could have made good money selling coffee , but they were too greedy . This is the result .
Very loud , average food and service . Bathrooms are disgusting , city officials should close this place down .
The sushi seemed pretty over priced , and I am not sure , but I think that both my friend and I got food poisoning from this place .
Food sucked way not worth the price and the service was horrible . Waited an hour for our food ! ! ! Not going back to that bdubs !
If you like dog food then I highly recommend this restaurant . This is worst food I have had in a long time . Nothing more I can really say .
Overpriced ! Many of the games were not working . Very loud even though it ' s an arcade . Pizza was horrible very greasy and tasted like it came from a cheap box .
I would avoid this hotel if possible . The staff is not helpful and the experience is not impressive . From check in to check out this hotel was not a good experience .
No wonder they ' re going out of business . Shitty service and overcharged me and wouldn ' t refund me the difference . They said it doesn ' t matter what the prices say .
The pot stickers were over cooked almost burnt . The teriyaki chicken tasted too salty . The orange chicken was OK . I ' ve had much better . Disappointed as it looked nice and smelled good .
Food overcooked , staff barely speak English , food served with practice plates , $ 33 for fajitas is outrageous .
Horrible , horrible , horrible service ! ! I don ' t know who are ruder the customers or the staff . I will never ever spend my money in that place again ! !
A tourist restaurant with low quality food . Don ' t bother go off the beaten path for a much finer dining experience .
Very bad service , slow and the taste of the food not worst your money . Ripped off . Never go back there again . Only one star for the decoration of the restaurant .
Disappointed with this hotel . Cigarettes smoke everywhere , air circulation in the lobby is terrible . Hotel reservations staff not so friendly . Beds showed signs of aging . Price was decent .
Inedible . Raw dough . Huge crowds . Rushed . There are better options out there . Ordered a large cheese pizza and was greatly disappointed
Avoid . Portion size is an absolute joke . Expect 1 / 2 of your sides and to be calling back asking who ate them on the way to your house .
I would really like this place if the music wasn ' t so loud . Turn the f $ & @ ing music down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It is ear piercing loud ! ! !
Worst restaurant experience of my life . Terrible service . Food took forever and was cold . Waitress didn ' t know what a wheat beer is .
I keep hearing this place is good . I keep finding it ' s bad . Even the margaritas .
Can ' t remember a time when they got an order right and I didn ' t have to wait over 20 minutes for it
In line 30 minutes and still got the order WRONG ! No utensils , napkins or an apology . Rude and slow workers .
Pretty average . Fries were packaged frozen as were chicken tenders . We were only people in the place on a weds afternoon . Burgers were grainy .
Horrible service . It ' s like a bother to ask them for a drink . Never coming again ! ! ! ! ! !
Overpriced $ 30 a person for cold bland food Don ' t waste your money ! ! go somewhere else ! !
DO NOT order sent me a table 9inches shorter than advertised . The glass did not fit the table . Than charged me to return them . Customer service sucks .
I have been here only once and that is enough . I was sick all night . I will not be back . 2 stars will be for location convenience and staff
Ate on the restaurant side . Average food . Horrible service , waitress got 3 things wrong with my husbands order . Way better places to spend your money on food in Vegas .
I STILL can not believe people like the steaks at this restaurant . Go figure !
Sat at the bar eating lunch and a cockroach walked around . Escaped before it could be killed . Yuck
Don ' t like the food . I can make a better garlic bread at home . The fish ( salmon ) didn ' t taste like a fresh salmon .
Mehhhh ! ! The food was mediocre , the drinks were terrible , and the service was the only good part . Would not go back : (
Be sure to ask to pricing for shots / drinks . Ordered the same shots twice and was charged very differently with one being excessively high .
Long wait for the food after I ordered . I got a single rocket . It was dry and over cooked . Disappointed .
5th time in a row I ' ve tried to go and they ' re sold out of chicken ! Obviously poor planning that doesn ' t change .
Very disappointing experience getting visa pictures . Long story but i would never come back . I hope you have better luck ! I ' ve used AAA passport pic services before with no issues .
I like Roberto ' s for a long time but now I won ' t be going back because of their political views
AWFUL . The salad bar was the only thing I could eat . Food is the lowest quality I ' ve ever seen at a buffet . Stay far away from this dump .
All I can say is , I wish I had gone somewhere else . If it weren ' t for some of the awesome professors then I wouldn ' t give this place any stars .
Service is terrible , you are waiting for at least 40 minutes for one roll . Just ridiculous and overrated . Won ' t be coming back here for sure .
I ordered a beef brisket soup and there was no meat in the soup . Complete waste of money .
Worst fried ice cream EVER . Guacamole was very bland . Would not go there again if I lived here . Flavors are bland .
Strong sewer odor as soon as you enter . Not the best first impression . Clean store and friendly staff though , thus the 2 stars .
I love most St . Luis location but this location was sadly the worst I ever went and the staff was so rude to me when we visit the store !
Store off Fort Apache - curly long hair employee VERY RUDE and disrespectful to customers . If you don ' t like your job , get another and stop taking your anger out on the customers .
DO NOT COME HERE . The services is extremely slow , our food was served almost an hour after we ordered .
Didn ' t use them because of the major hassle just to get someone scheduled . Horrible service .
Customer service is really bad and shawarma barely had any meat . Teach your staff basic manners when dealing with customers such as saying please and thank you .
Poor after sales service when ordering delivery . Took about 1 hr to resolve issue , and deliver missing items .
Baked apple pancake was horrible . . . Not worth the wait . Nothing was fresh . . , no flavor
This Panda Express made me sick . I have been using the bathroom ever since . I know it was the food as I hadn ' t ate all day . I will never go back here again .
Very much a typical McDs . My main concern was a real problem with flies inside and out . Makes me wonder how clean this place really is . Does Gordon Ramsay do chains ?
Found a wire in the served spaghetti . A waitress took it away without any apology . Really bad service and the food is plain . We don ' t recommend this restaurant .
Terrible service and very forgetful staff food took forever also didn ' t split the bills correctly after explaining twice we were sat outside and they rarely checked up on us
Ordered pizza at 530pm didn ' t receive pizza until 730pm . This was my first time using them . I don ' t think I ' ll use them again . Epic failure ! ! ! !
Everyone was super rude and condescending which is exactly what you want when your electronics are broken !
This place has gone down hill . The quality of food is no longer there . I was happier when it was more like fast food . I ' ll clean my table just make food better .
Came here a couple times thought it was decent . On my most recent visit they messed up my bill . I emailed them to correct but never heard back after the initial response .
Get more sizes please preferably smalls ! Instagram has many cute things but the store is different
Do not order online ! I ordered via their website and received a confirmation number . Only to find upon arrival they hadn ' t received / prepared my order . Subway it is .
Really slow . If it was fine dining I would expect to wait : 15 for a simple order of chicken strips . But it ' s not fine dining - - it ' s Burger King .
Worst experience ever ! Went to enjoy a birthday lunch only to recieve a bowl of grease and oil not once but twice ! If I could give no stars I would ! ! !
We were seated for 25 minutes and just utterly ignored by our server . No idea about the food because we never got to order . Really unenjoyable experience .
Feel like we were robbed , They tried to keep our debit card and then almost gotten a fight with the disgruntled employee in the parking lot when we left . Oh , slow service also .
This store was ok but then it moved and never opened up again . What a shame . It had potential
Save your money and time . Go elsewhere . Trust me . Both times I went here , I had to go home and clean the inside for left over debris and dirt that was left behind .
Waited about 20 min and couldn ' t even get a servers attention to order a drink . Ended walking out and took our business elsewhere .
Will not be back . Used to be a good discount store . Now it is lacking and they have hired rude college kids that don ' t do their jobs .
I just had the grilled chicken wrap and I already feel a little queasy . Do not eat here
The morons at the Republic did it again ! Invited all my Chicago friends over to watch the Bears / Packer game at 11AM - - - - no game as published .
Si me gusta la tienda pero a la hora De pagar es un dolor De wevo por Que no hay muchas cajeras abiertas . . .
Wasn ' t really impressed with this place the fruit was way over priced and the portion of fruit was extremely small
Not good for lunch . Bugs everywhere on the window sills . More of a night club atmosphere .
The worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life . Queso was not hot the cilantro pesto was nasty . everthing was served Luke warm and the lemonade was watery
Positives : - location ( inside PH ) - open 24 hours Cons : - lousy service - lousy food ( even when you ' re drunk )
Nice interior . Lousy service and extremely inconsistent coffee , so I started asking for tea here . . . they can screw up tea orders !
Never used them , and after seeing a gentleman who was driving one of their sedans the other day hitting on a woman in the car I never will .
The food was delicious and the selection was fantastic . However , my husband has been throwing up this evening and has food poisoning symptoms . This was the only place we ate today . Beware .
Food is not fresh , tastes like left overs . Paid $ 16 for weekday lunch including tax and tip . Not worth it .
Purchased the blue ink which had been used . Really feel very bad about this !
This is the slowest Starbucks in town . Unless you have a book to read or a sweater to knit - skip it .
Service is very slow . Took over 15 minutes before our server ever came out
Ride share pickup lookin like a crackhead bbq stand . Step it up CLE , you ' re better than that .
The prices seem kind of high and variation of product seems to be low . I like the place overall since its close .
Unfriendly service . Plain and the mediocre food . Nice seats on the outside , tough .
The food is just bland , and this is not ok when you sell $ 20 plates of noodles . Absolutely no reason to go to this place , even if you feel like chinese food .
Terrible experience . Rude server . Will never come back to this place . It appears that they don ' t care much about customer service .
Ugh , screw this place & there pushy salespeople and there lack of attention to detail . Go to TNT car wash for exceptional service .

Was there on Sunday June 11th . Food was just ok . There were a lot of fleas in the dining area . Made our time there really annoying . Must be a cleanliness problem .
This has got to be the worst experiences dealing with a governmental agency I ' ve ever had . That is to say , this is a subcontracted location under the banner of a governmental agency .
Everything great , food view , place , beer selection . But brutally slow kitchen . Makes taking the family a big challenge . Maybe happy hour with adults but never again with families .
burger was terrible . salad was ok . both not seasoned properly . their homemade ketchup was disgusting .
Food was good but service was terrible . Server Jess was not attentive . We had dinner here Sunday 5pm & it was not busy . I wil not comeback .
The lady cashier is very rude . I think she is the owner family . She keep nagging and yelling at her employees . Very bad customer service . And this is the cash only Vietnamese restaurant .
Reasonably priced compared to most yogurt places , but yogurt had a weird taste , like it was on the edge of spoiling . . . . yuck .
Excellent ambiance , excellent service , excellent presentation , fine music . The scallops and crabcake were simply subpar .
Don ' t waste your money unless you like food like Panda Express . The satay chicken was hard and plastic like . You get what you pay for . Lesson learned
the food is meh and some of the portions r too big tl b called tapas

They take so so long here to get a loan and seems like everyone here is new , have no clue what there doin .
An overall disappointing experience . Good food horrible service . Our waitress seemed more interested in flirting with another waiter then actually getting our cup of tea . 30 minutes waiting for those drinks !
First room wasn ' t clean second one still dirty , people were nice that helped me but the place is just super dirty ! Windows never washed , floor in the room dirty
Stay away far far away . Tacos were very greasy and the rice was dry . Not sure why this is rated 4 star way over rated .

This place sucks . The bouncers are so rude . Please spend your time and money going somewhere else .
Food is great once you get through the attitude of the employees . Countless mistakes on the orders . And it is FILTHY : the bathrooms , the dining area , the tables and so on .
Good portions , and the fish is fresh . But , , , , im not feeln the rice that comes w / the Negeri . just my opinion
From the stale peanuts at the beginning of the line where it starts . Then for $ 13 bucks , forget it . I can eat for same price for two people and be IN and OUT burger
Overrated . . . the cupcake was not good . The cake was too crumbly and dry ! The customer service was fantastic .
Food looks and tastes mediocre at best , definitely not authentic . Prices are cheap , but it shows . Service is spotty . Only good thing is that they have a large menu .
The burger is not that good , they ran out of short ribs although it was 2pm and the fish and chips was too dry : ( But to be fair the stake was perfect
Very misleading . Their after 12am menu is only reserved for those who choose to dine in . BEWARE ! ! !
No custermor service , out of stuff and can ' t up grade to larger size , is what don ' t even want ; why come here
The only good thing here is the omelette bar at least it ' s not dripping in oil ! Save your money and go to Starbucks !
This location cannot handle delivery orders properly . They canceled my order after 30 minutes waiting time without giving me any chance now order anything as all kitchens are closed .
Bland . Dirty glasses . No chicken tacos . Cramped - practically sit on a stranger ' s lap . Small portions . The tempeh comes with just one piece of canned pineapple . Music is good .
Visited on a Thursday night around 8 pm . Pizza choices on cold tray like at Sbarro ' s . Reheated by the slice . ugh . Very disappointed .
I ordered a cup of latter and it took them 20 minutes to make it ! After 20 minutes of waiting , the cup comes with stains on it ! Overall is very disappointing
i dont know if the management changed again ? the place smells of cleaning supply when you enter . the buffet is horrible . its almost like the dishes are fightng for the worst tasting food competition .
The hotel needs major renovation , amenities are minimal . Its only redeeming quality is the easy walk to the convention center .
Renting room for an NRA fundraiser - no thanks ! ! Won ' t be complicit ! ! ! ! Stay away . Stand with the teens in Florida ! Not the NRA $ $ $ !
This place sucks . Edible and sanitary , but that ' s it . Not worth a full review . Don ' t go here . I ' m right about this .
Food came almost an hour late . The waiters did not let us know about the status of our food either . I recommend getting the butter chicken and naan . Biriyani was not pleasing to eat .
Over priced . They ran out of food and plates ! ! This is the second time that something ! !
This place was horrible . The food was cold and took forever to get service . I ' ll not go back .

I ' ve made reservations here twice on two different occasions and both times my reservations where cancelled for a private event and no one cared enough to call or email me . Horrible service .
Chuck and Ryan , rude , Chuck dropped my bike off the rack . NEVER going back . Mary was nice , I ' ll take my bikes to somewhere that knows what customer service is
Is there anything positive about a 3 + hour wait for a drivers license renewal ? I think not .

Service is ok , only if u know Spanish . Shrimp quesadilla is no good , the tiny mini steam shrimp in between two piece of tortillas . I don ' t think I would go back .
It ' s descusting NY buffet was really good and now closed . I don ' t see how anyone can stand to eat here food is old and cold and not even worth 6 $
Just a so so place . Service is poor and employees seen arguing . Food is good and great atmosphere for County Music .
Not bad food for being so corporate . I do have to say , they ' re pretty stingy with their napkins .
If you want to get ripped off , belittled , and treated like garbage . . . then this is the place for you . I RECOMEND NO ONE shop here . Horrible business ethics all around .
Horrible . The food flavour is disgusting and to top it all off the driver expects a tip . .
Overpriced ; mediocre food and drinks ; sub - par service . Blah . I was really excited for the brewery ' s opening but it has left me very disappointed overall .
I have shopped Publix since they came to Rock Hill . After the customer service experience I had August 18th , I will no longer give my business to Publix .
THEY ARE CLOSED . We drove over there last night searching the whole shopping center & found building 101 . . . Vacant !
Typical Walmart took off a couple stars because Customer service is rude like all Walmarts and the employees move like they are in slow motion to be expected but now they are not open 24 hours anymore

Horrendous restaurant . . . Overpriced , mediocre food . Avoid at all costs .

The worst Starbucks ever in my life . I ordered Javachip frappuccino , it wasn ' t even unsweet . It was freaking BITTER ! dont even try it from here .
Terrible service , horrible prices for the type of food . Ghost town and once we were served , I can understand why .
A shawarma shop without shawarma , saying they stopped serving it for the night despite over two hours left before closing . No wonder it was empty . I left .
Always wonderful food over the years until yesterday , when our delicious meal yielded food poisoning for my husband and me . Not happy at all , and won ' t be back .
Nothing much to say but I love craft beer and I wasn ' t highly impressed with this place ! Beerhaus blows it away !
Worst service from any business of any kind . I couldn ' t be more disappointed . I will never recomend or reuse their service .
Typical chain food . Nothing special . Wait staff seemed like they ' d rather be elsewhere .
Overall given the price i was expecting better food and service
Terrible service . I saw my bartender once throughout our time there . Won ' t come back for mediocre ambience , and terrible service .
Good food but SLOW to get order . If waiting fifteen minutes for fast is acceptable then they need to reevaluate how they do business
Large selection but high prices , unhelpful staff and dust on the cigars make this place terrible . Spend your money at leaf and bean or allegheny smokeworks , at least there they appreciate their customers
Food was just ok . Overpriced like everything else . Expected better since I live Motley Crue . Good took forever too . Slllllllooooowwwww . Waitress was nice .
I ' ll get right to the point : meat quality - decent , side dishes - OK , SERVICE - Horrible !
Great atmosphere by the lake but the food is just okay . Been here 3 times and ordered different things and food is always cold . Service is also just okay .
Had to ask the waitress twice for water , then she disappeared and we couldn ' t receive our check . Dishwasher also walked out while we were there . . .
Service 1 / 5 when you finish eating they ask you to leave . Food 3 / 5 nothing special Price 3 / 5 They don ' t care because of location .
My actual hair cut was fine , the styling and customer service was quite poor . Won ' t be going back .

I read in my subway paper that this place has cucarachas ! EW ! !
Not good place , they don ' t care and respect the costumer . People are waiting to open and they come so late . Don ' t recommended this place
Sat at the bar for 15 minutes before bartender showed up then he took our drink order and disappeared for another 15 minutes . We walked out . Prices are way high
Tons of beers . Typical bar type food served . Not a beer drinker , and they don ' t offer great beer for us folk .
The food was over priced for the quality and tasted just ok . The waitress was rude when when asked for separate checks . Food took forever to come out .
The place is very dark and crowded . Service is too slow , and our wait or has a bit attitude problem . Pasta under cooked and pizza dou was burnt .
Very long wait . Once I got my food the fries and fish were overcooked , cold and underseasoned .
The pizza is terrible , and the employees aren ' t nice at all . My pizza was raw and all of the toppings slipped off
Extremely over priced for the portion size . Poor customer service - including the whopping surcharge for something basic like sriracha . Go elsewhere ! ! ! !
Waited 1 hour and 25 minutes for my delivery . The pizza was cold when it arrived ! Very dissatisfied and would not recommend this place to anyone .
I got an egg roll today . I vomited thirty minutes later . I have felt great since which makes me think it was the eggroll . Avoid .
disgusting ice from the machine is always crushed into smalls , my popcorn shrimps were hard and old . . don ' t go
This location has no dipping sauces today the shake machine is awesome down and customer service actually sucks today .
35 cents to use my debit card ? This is the 21st century right ? And beer selection sucks . . .
The food was half descent , but they were completely intolerant of the fact that I spoke English ( I ' m from out of town ) and seemed very hostile and intolerant .
Overall it was disappointing . Noodles were soggy and nothing was seasoned corecctly . Asked gor very spicy and there was no heat . Gets 2 stars becaus the fried rice and eggrolls are great .
I go in so I can order two hot hot n spicys and they took forever to do it but they made a complicated customer order so quick but my simple order is put aside wth
Usually a big fan but the last time I ordered it took 2 hours to come to my house . Not happy . Stick with dining in .
This place is lucky I have to give them a star such lazy staff it ' s crazy except the guy that did my toes . . But the guy that did my nails is very very lazy
Food quality comparable to that of a public high school cafeteria . . . . not a good one .
Their chips were cold , old and stale . It was too tough to eat . The cashier couldn ' t even speak English . Not going to come here again .
the girl working was 30 minutes late set a bad mood i in charlotte just standing around it not safe in charlotte
Salad was large and fresh , decent flavor . Lots of other stuff to try . Kind of a mid - scale Mexican restaurant .
Not worth a penny of the cost ! My bachelors cost more that my daughter ' s REAL degree and has far less value . I am saddled with student loans that will haunt me forever .
Not bad , but not great either Prefer this place to Future Shop , but never really had anything positive I could say . It seems efficient and problem free I guess
A bit bland , long waits . Decent healthy options and price . Overall , I ' ve just had way better breakfast elsewhere .
Overpriced , salty and overrated ! ! ! Why this place is so popular I will never understand .
Maybe it was just what we ordered but the noodles and broth were bland and the broccoli was over cooked and oddly seasoned .
Quoted my girlfriend $ 40 for an oil change . Bill showed up at $ 133 without warning . What is that ? How does it cost $ 133 to get the oil changed on a 2015 VW ?
This was an OK place , but I ' m married to an Italian girl who frankly does a better job with authentic Italian .
Always double check your order . They rarely get it right . Just got home and they forgot to give me the cookies I ordered . They don ' t qualify check , so you ' d better .
The workers are very unprofessional and rude I already cancel my memberships with both cars and take my business somewhere else
Rude front desk . Slow check in . I ' ll forever go the extra miles and stay somewhere else & I recommend you do too . Safe travels
Might want to update your voicemail when there is a holiday ( Labor Day ) instead of saying that you ' re open . Otherwise what ' s the purpose of a recording
Food was good to start . . . until later in that evening both my boyfriend and I have been up all night vomiting !
Appointment was at 11 , arrived at 10 : 45 and had to wait until 12 : 30 . Tons of people in the waiting room . Stop overbooking and see your patients in a timely manner .
Ohhh im sorry i thought when you placed an order you were not supposed to get one less meal , hope my boy enjoyed watching everyone eat . chicken club sandwich was awesome .
The worst cleaner around . Poor service , quality and price . Do not go here .
Neat little place but the DJ plays his music way too LOUD ! It would be understandable if the place was packed , but this guy blasts it with 4 people sitting at the bar .
OK . . . . REAALY ? ? ! ! Take my beer bottle back to the bar to order anther damn BEER ? ? ! C ' MON Man ! !

Update to this review , 24 days later and we still have NOT received ANY refund to the food we did not get nor did we receive any gift cards or anything in the mail ! Absolutely unacceptable !
Extremely bad customer service I ever had . The cashier said she does not know how to refund the item when I asked for refunding a bottle of water , $ 5 . 69 .
Sitting outside waiting for service for over 15 minutes . . drove over an hour to eat here from Waxhaw , Nc . . . Finally someone came over . Ughhhhhh great view poor service . Disappointed .
Waited for 35 minutes from order to pick up in the store . The taste is average but had a really bad stomachache after having their red bean ice .
Massage services were great . Hair was sub - par . I had to go back for a recolor . I wouldn ' t go back there again .

If I could give this place no stars , I would . Absolute shit . . . . . screw you guys , learn how to do your freaking job .
Terrible , shady service . Period . Oh , and car dealership not really close to a subway that offers NO shuttle service ? ?
The Library Bar is exactly what you should expect from Snottsdale . Rude service and high prices . Nice curb appeal , ugly attitude .
No one greets you at the door , tables are wobbly , drinks are watered down and service is lacking . Too many other great options around , don ' t waste your time here .
Get your hours correct . It ' s inconvenient for the hours to say one thing and drive all the way there and it closes a whole hour early .
Just had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life here . The server was incredibly rude and the hot pot was disgusting . Find another place !
This place never has fudge available . I come about once a month and they always say they ' ll have it later but they never do . The attitude is horrible and they expect a tip !
Service was good but the food to me was a bit of a let down . I ' ve always wanted hand pulled noodles but it didn ' t taste that great to me .
it is really too bad that the only issue with this place is the owner ' s wife . this was by far our worst experience with any bike shop in toronto .
Food is good ; if you know how to order . Untrained staff has difficulty explaining menu and how to help customers order ! @ ! ! Second time through and worse than the first !
Terrible service . Started with giving our table away to wrong ppl , incorrect drink orders , incorrect food , late food , terribly mixed margaritas . The list goes on .
Before they changed owners I love going in there but now definitely not , greeted by rude servers and not a thank you or you ' re welcome . Very sad ! !
Well the ice cream desserts are tops , but while the burgers TASTE fab , they are so thin that even a double doesn ' t cut it !
Please stop putting the large fries on top of tacos ! ! ! It ' s fucking stupid ! AND NO ONE WANTS BROKEN TACOS !
Had to wait a very long time to get food on table . Missed out on attractions just waiting for food . Pizza too tasted very dry . Very disappointed .
Chef SPAT yes SPAT on the ground ! Then he sneezed , that would be acceptable if he did spit just moments before . I have never seen such behavior in a restaurant before . Stay away !
What kind of a kwik trip only has one toilet ? ? ? Popular location - NOT a quick stop if you are a lady
Worst . Chinese . Delivery . Ever . Chicken so overcooked , egg roll so greasy , stir fry noodles so salty . Never , NEVER , again .
Way better chicken places in Montreal . This place is obviously for the weekday / downtown office lunch crowd . Overpriced , just ok food but I was starving and ate it .
Food is decent . Service is so - so . It is a so - called fast / semi fine dining . What can you expect from a bring - your - own - wine place ?
There ' s no way to reach them . I tried calling multiple times and I keep getting an answering service and leaving a message but then never getting a call back . Not a great business model .
I paid $ 6 . 00 for an order of breaded mushrooms . There were 11 mushrooms when my order arrived . Total rip off and won ' t be repeating this mistake .
Food and service was average not really worth the price . I think they charge way too much for its worth . I ' d rather go to Pho kim long few minutes away from this place
Over priced . The chocolate salted caramel cupcake tasted like an ice cream sandwich . I give it 2 stars .
Bad service , front desk very rude ! ! ! ! They kept us waiting for a room for 1 : 30 minutes without offering at least a glass of water ! Really bad will never stay here again
Well , they ' re CLOSED . The location is up for lease . Oh well . CLOSED CLOSED Jeez , how long does a yelp review have to be until they post it ?
They don ' t take AMEX and their food is really bland . Guy Fieri is full of crap . Last time I get burned on a Food Network referral .
Everything was good and fast , except they didn ' t put chicken in double chicken salad . That was pretty upset for hungry me , especially when you paid for this fcking CHICKEN !
I don ' t know about fish tacos . . . I am vegetarian . . . Vegetarian food sucks . . . I tried 4 things and all were equally bad . .
They use to use beef pepperoni now they don ' t . I or dared mushrooms and he gave me a plan cheese pizza . Not cool . Go to Little Ceasars .
My cat had a cardiac arrest while they performed a dental . They still charged me for the dental . Very caring !
Dang it , why do I keep coming back . Crappy service everytime . Getting a menu here is near impossible after the sunsets . Getting the waiters to come over afterwards is even harder .
Don ' t waste your money , crap food , poor service because short on servers
Worst place ever Stay away for this food / people Not clean wonder how the still open
The customer service is mediocre at best . The food is probably one of the worst seafood / fish restaurants I ' ve ever experienced . Just save yourself the money and don ' t go there .
The worst drink They gave me passion juice instead of passion martini and I asked them to make it stronger and he said I have to charge $ 13 more . . . . . . .
Pizza , Burgers , beer . Least expensive joint at Rio . Ok food , service is pretty slow , seating limited .
Leticia was my server for my visit . Don ' t come here at all . It ' s a waste of time & money on some bad service & nasty food .
Usually they have great food but today was a bad experience . There was egg shells and clear plastic casing in my meal . I ' m sure it was just a off day for the cook .
Just adequate . Price and location attracted us but when when we registered a $ 50 deposit was required . What a surprise . Again just adequate .
Charged me 12 . 50 for a red bull vodka on happy hour , no warning . . . What u think this is time square ? Check yourself . . .
Terrible tasting food . Ordered curry and got soggy veggies and totally wrong flavor . On the bright side , service was good despite the poor tasting food .
This is 24 hour fitness and you can ' t find another time to clean steam room sauna and pool area .

Service is poor . It was basically self service I had to grill and cut the meet begin to end . Server didn ' t even come to my table and ask anything .
Good food but HORRIBLE customer service , even worse during breakfast when the place is empty . Food not worth the hassle of waiting to get someone ' s attention .
No customer service . Food is ok , but no smiles , girl at the counter couldn ' t even look me in the eyes . Just need better training . .
This is a true whisky bar but the meat was covered in salt and pepper and that was all you tasted not a good experience won ' t go back
Big sign outside saying open for lunch , but doors are locked and no one inside and it ' s only 1 : 30pm .
Don ' t believe the hype . . . it ' s a solid 4 out of 10 service was a bit slow . The food lacked flavour and was not very fresh .
Bitch for a bartender . Horrible attitude and gave me a beer I did not order and told me to pay for it . Never treated me or guest with any curtesy . Never going back
Nice variety but only fair taste . Worth a visit if you want a large buffet with a good variety . Don ' e expect anything outstanding though .
Bar is too crowded . Too many " saved " seats while others stand . Not very accommodating . Good martini ' s . Could be friendlier .
I will never eat here again . Couldn ' t enjoy any of my food because all the hard stuff in my asada , worse tacos ever !

Usually go here and everything went great until my sister started throwing up and not feeling well in her stomach after drinking a drink I got her ) :
Suitable for wrapping fish , but little else ; editorial opinion masquerading as news reporting and one of the most dystopian websites I ' ve ever had the displeasure to navigate . Boo , hiss .
The pizza tastes like they Dumped a whole container of pepper in the sauce but the chicken wings had no taste I gave it one star because the waitress was good
Avoid the soups , especially the Hong Kong wonton . It ' s not what one would expect a wonton soup would be .
Quite disappointed that half of the doughnuts on the menu board . . . they don ' t make at that location .
Wow cockroaches in the bathroom ! Gllad we saw them before we ate . If I could leave no stars I wiuld .
The ride itself was lovely . The preparation before the ride was atrocious .
Worst policy ever . Cancelation charges $ 50 . Meaningless policy to loot peoples money . Dont ever rent here , rather pay little more money and have a peaceful life rather than dealing with these guys .
I couldn ' t even eat the food , the sewage smell was so bad I gagged ! ! ! I mean how can you not smell it while sitting in here eating
They did a horrible job with my eye brows : ( they were so thin and didn ' t have a shape I mean they are sweet people but still ! : (
Used yelp to find an Eastern European restaurant and drove all the way , only to find it closed ! Very disappointed since it says it ' s open until 11pm and we got there at 9pm .
Worst customer service making us wait over 20 mins while the restaurant is empty , just because we were wearing shorts ! Very disrespectful !
While service was friendly and prices were reasonable the chocolate dipped cone lacked flavor .
Horrible food . For 7 star we got unbearably spicy food . Waitress was rude when I asked fr changing the spice level , and asked me to pay fr both orders .
Please clean your floor properly . It feels like Crisco under your feet . Very dangerous .
Another non descript indian restaurant . . . same menu same overcooked food . Sadly no indian restaurant does justice to indian cuisine .
Rather mediocre coffee and pastries . Tables and counter aren ' t very clean . This place could be much better .
Worked at the Kmart across the parking lot . . . My coworkers got a burrito there , and found a bug in it ! ! Ewww !
Food is alright but fuck it ' s expensive for being a previous tire shop in the ghetto .
Holly cow . . . I cannot believe this place is actually recommended by yelp . Nothing special at all , normal run of the mill food , not even close to 4 star . . . WOW .
Horrible customer service . Been on hold for 30 minutes trying to reach someone . . . . .
Rooms are decent but loud . Internet sucks which is why I won ' t be back . Not a great place . Service was ok , wireless internet is unreliable .
The food was too sweet , it doesn ' t taste like Thai food , service was bad , and there was a cockroach in the bathroom .
Avoid this place . Only ate there because everywhere else was busy . Noodles had no texture . Doesn ' t taste authentic . Won ' t RTE .
Terrible service ! ! I got so sick of waiting , I finally left ! ! I went up the road to a better Mexican restaurant instead .
Awful food . Period . I could and should write a lengthier review , but aside from the friendliness of the server , there isn ' t anything to write about - never again .
I have friends who love this place , and the food can be good . But my personal interactions with them have been not so great : (
Literally 30 min in the drive through . . . I could have made 30 burgers in less time . . . staff looked scary . . manager loomed more scary . . place looked very filthy .
Not good food . Poor service . Would rather eat at taco bell . Shame because could be a good place . Never again . Should be zero stars .
Terrible service and flavorless food . Worst Mexican any of us have ever eaten . Don ' t waste your time . We ' ll never be back .
Great food . Very reasonable . The worst bartender before the Indians game and the bar was not even crowded . . . rude , condescending , and the reason for the 1 star
Horrible experience with the Assistant Manager Tim D . Horrible attitude as he was RUSHING me thru . Then stated that he had to rush to keep up . That or get more cashiers Tim . Garbage Service .
I got food poisionin from this place last night , i do not like this location . i got sick af i ordered 3 chicken tacos and carne asada fries never aagain
The sweet and sour pork lacks flavor and didn ' t have enough sauce or vegetables in it
Really awful service . Waited and waited and waited . An hour and a half . Even when they weren ' t busy we still couldn ' t be helped . Awful .
I have had better food in the east coast where there is not this level of competition . Will never return to this place .
Food is awesome but even if you ' re playing , they charge you for drinks . There are plenty of places where you can drink for free if you ' re playing .
Lots and lots of very mediocre food . Cheerful but loud waitress . This place had a wait list full of huge patrons on a Saturday morning .
Last resort the day manager is a real D " bag " typically go to this place late at night
If you are looking for a relaxing hookah experience with a chill ambience this NOT the place . Hookah was good , but the environment was horrendous . Excessively loud music and obnoxious crowd .
Good food but all three people I went with got food poisoning . All three had rotisserie chicken . Won ' t be going back soon .
Where do i start the food sucks the place stinks . It smells like a old trailer
Arnaqueurs ils profitent de l ' afflux de touristes et n ' offrent pas un service décent , bouffe correcte mais prix cher pour ce que c ' est et vous font payer l ' eau !
Ordered a few deliveries and they always forget something . Food doesn ' t taste as good as when I first ate here .
very bad service had to wait to be seated for about 5 minutes server in . the bathroom didn ' t wash her hands no good service at all
The server offered a taster , but took it to another table . After 20 minutes , we had to flag down a different server to get a beer .
Terrible service & expensive . $ 13 for 10 wings and no fries ? ? ? ? You can go to Ramsey burgers & get a GREAT burger for $ 14 . Save your money and time .
Beef salad : too salty and chewy Pineapple fried rice : too sweet Panang curry : sauce is good , but pork is chewy Small portion over all . Not recommended
Parking is very dirty , it seems like nobody was hired to keep the front neat . People drive crazy even in parking lots . I certainly don ' t want to come back
Great food . Not so great wait staff . Never a smile never pleasant greeting . Please work on the young ladies to be more friendly .
Super duper friendly service , but I am here to eat , and it is mediocore food at best .
Are they killing the chicken back there ? I only order 3 chicken tenders and it took over 45 minutes . Very slow service . Eat at HOOTERS .
Busy location , can be difficult to get in and out . Service is friendly but slow . Food is your basic McD ' s fast food . Would go elsewhere if you are in the area .
Food was nothing special , I actually regretted of not staying home and cooking dinner myself . Szechuan chicken not spicy at all . Veggies were just horrible .
Looks like I did my manicure myself . Try to talk u into other services by bullying or insulting you .
Happy hour is not so happy anymore the ahi app was 8 now 13 along with most apps almost doubled Tommy Bahamas is a better deal now
Friendly service , clean environment . Took 23 minutes for me to get a latte . Coffee was just okay . . .
Asian food that tastes little like authentic Asian food - - even less than something like a PF Changs , I can ' t say I was impressed . I won ' t be returning to this place .
I don ' t understand all the good reviews here . The hibachi here is like avg mall food court quality . I guess if you want quantity over taste , this place does ok then .
Super friendly staff ! But my $ 20 . 00 chicken fried steak was a huge Debbie Downer ! Not worth it ; (
food with flies flies also flying around people eating flies on my food tell me anybody see flies clean that place get then flies out nasty
I was disappointed to experience that both the service & food quality are not consistently good . I won ' t be going back .
Dont go , their food is average at best and they wont honor many coupons - including Restaurant . com ! Just bad business to have coupons and promos out there that they wont honor .
Unbelievably rude staff . I felt unwanted the entire time I was there . The cashier rolled her eyes at me and sighed after I asked her for a plastic bag . Won ' t be going back .
Fail . Ordered 2 chicken breast and drum stick . Got home 1 chicken breast and drum stick . Not the first time they have done this to me which makes me . Check your food before leaving .
I have no idea how anyone could give this place a good review . The service is horrid , the wings were way over fried , dry , dry , dry . I would not recommend this place .
This is not worth trip . Sauce tasted canned . Nothing special about the lasagna or fetucinne Bolognese . Wont be back . Better places around
Will not go back . Food was very bland . Ordered asparagus as a vegetable and received 8 stalks with no tips .
Raw chicken sandwich . Sent it back with waitress . Never saw a manager . Very disappointed .
3rd time in a row they messed up my order ! And offer no solution my management not here now ! A complete joke and food going down hill as well as service obviously ! Not good !
This place is good for tequila drinks and chips . The food was extremely bland and over priced for what it was . The decor is cool however . Lots of tequila ' s to choose from .
basic italian food . nothing new nor special . i ate it though and was happy and full . probably wouldnt go back . the garlic rolls that come with your meal are the bomb though !
Horrible pizza ! ! Don ' t waste your money . So many other places that are much better . I can ' t see how other people gave this 4 stars ? ? ? ?
Terrible unfriendly service in an empty restaurant . Who do you people think you are ? All out of a job soon I hope .
This place is like dirty Mexico in the middle of Scottsdale . Not a fan .
No one smiles at this location , as a customer I feel like I am an inconvenience instead is a customer ugh
I got the chicken tacos and the brisket tacos . . . no flavor on any of the meat , so I was a little disappointed . . . they ' re ok for taco Tuesday for lunch .
The slots are the worst . I have ever seen . Too many penny slots of the same crap . The cafe was pretty good . Close to mother in laws house , but won ' t be back
Convenient most of time , but probably the worse grocery store ever to visit . Long lines because there are never enough lines open and the help in every department lack any customer service experience and it shows
again again again this place is really starting to suck . i hate that this Rallys keeps messing up my orders
I wasn ' t too impressed . It is basically a part over now the restaurant which serves meat and everything else so it is the same kitchen which is a dealbreaker for a lot of vegans
Ordered takeout from this place and regretted it . Calamari was like fried onion rings had never had it served that way . Was really greasy and gross . The soup was just alright .
We arrived 5 minutes early for our 730pm reservation only to be told we have to wait an additional 20 minutes . That Tapas Bar across the street looks good right about now .
Terrible service , could not get help from any sales staff . Left after waiting for an hour .
Service was attentive . The food generally was undercooked . The dessert obviously sat in a fridge overnight ( perhaps several ) .
Dishonest , overpriced , was quoted 1600 . 00 for a 300 dollar brake job . Go somewhere else .
Old tvs dirty booths . Ceiling in disrepair . no organization . Floors not swept . Strange decor with no consistently . menu bloated . Wish i could pay from table . Very closed in maze layout .
This was an awful experience . Just like buying a used car . The salesman leaches your money away . After waiting forever to get my glasses I eventually got them . . . . Awful
This company stole my money and gave me nothing in return . court case criminal . DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE CRIMINALS
I heard good things about this bakery . It wasn ' t terrible but the selection was not what I was expecting .
Was so excited to be here . But food was Luke warm ribs were tuff . cornbread is good . Pulled pork sandwich lacked seasoning and pork was dry .
Got the pho and rotten bean spouts to go with it . . . yummy . When asked to replace it they sorry they didn ' t have fresh ones . So no bean spouts
Not worth the detour . . . . You can eat better at home . The best part of the meal was the beer .
Can I even write a review with ZERO stars ? Negative stars ? THE most disgusting food to ever touch my lips . We threw our salty food away and hopped over to yogurt land .
I did not like the chicken . It was to dry . Idk I did not enjoy it and I will not be going back .
These guys are criminals . Absolutely worthless . Do not do business with these people .
Absolutely worst car wash . Didn ' t even attempt to clean . Barely wiped down inside . Didn ' t vacuum . Waste of money .
I am currently sitting in the IMAX theater here at the AMC Westgate . The movie was supposed to start at 9 : 45 pm . The movie has yet to start , it is 9 : 50pm .
Had lunch with a friend in their basement dining area . Service was veryyyy slow every step of the way , possibly he also had to cover tables upstairs and outside .
Steak was charred burnt and bitter . It was also extremely salty . The ambiance was nice though just the steaks were disappointing .
Clumsy ordering system with no help from hip hop wait staff only to receive dry , burnt food . Pass .
Cookies are hard even when " hot pressed " Cookies aren ' t soft or warm , just HARD pressed . So disappointed !
Wake me up when they start offering all day breakfast . . Considering it ' s the only edible thing McDonald ' s even makes . Also the drive through here is slow as molasses .
customer service sucks . . workers are never smiling or friendly at all . all with faces of not wanting to work . not going back
Took over an hour for our food to come out . Cashier gave our pupusas to her family members who came in and placed order after us . Horrible customer service
Overpriced , average food . Don ' t know what all the hype is about .
Need to uodate your store hours . . . only open until 10 PM . Made me drive and the place is closed .
The food is tasty ( most of the time ) but the service is terrible . The manager is rude and the bartenders are not friendly . Wouldn ' t recommend !
Inquired about a new Ford Explorer and this is the lovely unprofessional email received .
Great variety of meat but I didn ' t like the texture . Duck fat fries are delicious and a must try !
First timer . Not all that . . . Food was warm not hot . Music was loud . . . Great employees
Very underwhelming . Chicken shawarma wrap was okay , mostly just tasted the pickles . Tabouli just tasted like a bowl of wet parsley , no flavour aside from plain parsley and water . Too bad .
If I could give it 0 stars I would . Terrible service . Dirty rooms especially the bathroom . Sad !
Very disappointed and embarrassed ! Brought out of town guest to have dinner . Our waitress was very unfriendly and service was bad !
DO NOT GO ! Expense , can ' t rate service because there is none ! Want a great hamburger ? Go to Red Robin ! !
Absolutely terrible ! Scam artists , over priced and awful service . Don ' t waste your time , go to a more reputable place to get your brakes done .
Lots of hype for a burger smashed into its foil wrapper and drowned in ketchup & mustard . Fries are soggy and flavorless . Staff was very nice , however .
Before you think your just gonna swing by the DMV you better take a lunch and prepare for the 6 - 8 hour wait . Those good old days were it only took you 2 hours are long gone
This is not closed but horribly slow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Ridiculous ! ! ! People are literally driving over curbs to get out of the drive thru ! !
Not the best . Veggies and herbs on our ban mhi not fresh . Pho not flavorful . " Siracha " tasted like Tabasco . Sad because so close to home but won ' t go back .
Very pricey for what you get . Far too acoustically live , so the echoes are deafening . Friendly service , but like most Madison spots that hire students , the staff needs more training .
An ok haircut for an ok price . You get what you pay for at this place . Defiantly hit or miss as far as haircut quality . Staff was not very pleasant .
2 . 50 transaction ATM fee . Come on . FCUs are supposed to stick together . Oh wait . This is vegas .
This restaurant has steadily declined in service , and messed up orders . I hope the management team somewhere sees ASAP !
Horrible ! Possibly the worst Americanized fake Mexican I have ever had and way over priced . If you are in Vegas and want Mexican , go to the Taqueria Canonita at The Venetian .
It ' s a bit overrated , service is great but food is mediocre , I may give it another chance but tonight I was disappointed .
This is not the Ethiopian food I know and the meat quality is poor and it is over priced I would not recommend this to anyone
Ordered a cappuccino , not hot & cost $ 4 . I rather spend the budget on Starbucks ! Do not add almond milk to the coffee based drink , mine taste sour : (
Lousiest BWW I have ever been to ! ! The staff has no energy , everyone looks unhappy , I am here on a Saturday afternoon at 2 : 00 the place looks like a graveyard !
We stopped to eat here . Not a real sir down restaurant . You have to walk through a line to order your food . It wasn ' t very impressed with me stay here in
They add a 4 . 57 % charge on the bill to cover overheads . Apparently $ 15 for a beer doesn ' t cover all their costs . Bad business practice .
I ordered a large . All mushrooms . Half with pepperoni and half pineapple . They made my pizza wrong . They offered to fix it . And they still made it wrong .
NO MORE Peanut Butter Cookies : ( AND they stopped making my favorite wrap - The Maverick . No reason to go back .
I need to visit this place . Lots of raves by friends . I really need to visit . ( Haven ' t been there yet ) .
Good coffee , thanks for the burnt bagels ! That I asked not to be toasted or warmed . And the unfriendly customers service , geez ever heard of saying Hello ?
This place used to be excellent but is now mediocre at best . Maybe they changed ownership . Don ' t bother .
This place I believe is permanently closed . Was in the area and wanted DQ , drove by and the windows were boarded up . Hope this helps !
This place is terrible . If it wasn ' t for the doctor I wouldn ' t come back . The girls that work this place are terrible .
Service is bad here . Food does not come all at once . Be prepared to eat in shifts . Food is average . Burger place next door is better .
1 star for the soda that was the best thing I had here . The Asada taco didn ' t have no taste , and the pork taco was burnt . The cashier was rude .
Dinner took 45 min to arrive despite few customers in the restaurant . How long are you willing to wait ? Staff kept saying it would be ready soon . Will think twice before going there again .
Make sure you keep all communications from this place regarding billing . This was a mess from a billing stand . Drs are ok but not sure I would recommend them
Just got back from King Putt . $ 10 for about 20 minutes of the lamest mini golf i ' ve ever played . Go to the pinball museum on E . Tropicana and skip King Putt .
I ate shawarma plate , it was good taste , but next day had a terrible abdominal pain I had to stay home , due to vomiting and diarrhea . Definitely not coming back .
Sour warm milk , floaters in the tea , dirty silverware , and a waitress that rolled her eyes during ordering . Needless to say our order was canceled and we left , too scared to eat here .
Food was ok , the girl at the register was RUDE ! ! ! For the price of the food and the location of this place I would think they would be a little nicer !
Drove all the way the this restaurant for them to tell me they ' re closed for their lunch break . It ' s states on their yelp that they ' re open until 9pm .
This place is trash . Rude employees and very poor customer service . The only thing this place is good at is getting your order wrong . I suggest fire your employees or retrain them .
They mopped in front of me and I got wet with the mop . Wtf . I used to be a server and was alway told never to mop 5 - 10 feet near customers . . .
es el peor servicio ! pedí información de mis taxes y insultaron a mi esposo ! ! ! son unos groseros y nada profesionales ! ! !
Normally i dont write negative reviews but the employees are very rude at this location . The merchandise is great but over priced if you dont have a coupon .
Overall it was ok . Quick service for lunch but small portions . Reasonably priced and friendly service . Food is so - so .
Terrible experience with doctors and PA and their bedside manner . Do not suggest going there . Go to a professional .
An hour and a half wait . . . Really ? Kinda an epic fail and not coming back even when that was my first attempt to try the establishment .
Food here could be better . The meat is anything but fresh Needs a lot of work Not short review Not short review Not short review
Do NOT order a bowl of anything here . . . the bowl is very tiny and costs $ 5 . The manager even said that the size of the bowl is just a cup .
Drinks are expensive . Security lady was super rude and grabbed / pulled me by my coat .
This is probably the worst subway I ' ve been to . The customer service is horrible . He was listening to music while taking our orders and he couldn ' t even hear what we wanted .
Guy here , Why do you need to have a girl with you to see the male dancers seems crazy
I would like to sign up and join with you guys . . . but your link isn ' t a " click away " . . . .
Took my car there a couple days ago and was very disappointed in the quality of work . I ended up having to rewash it , just to get the windows properly cleaned
Poor ass service . Food is sub par . Won ' t be coming back . Girls trying to be pretty . . . Please !
Total crap service and the food was worse . Trying to get creamer was more difficult than finding what customer service actually meant here . Needless to say I won ' t be returning .
What ' s the big deal about this place ? ! Over - rated truly . The food was ' okay ' but nothing to be wowed about .
Ok it was straight - this was the only place close to my house that would take me in at the last minute .
Soggy take out tacos . . Fell apart a few minutes after picking them up . They should use double tortillas . Also the cashier was inexperienced . Nothing amazing about the tacos . . Pretty boring .
It was way over priced and the food was blah . It was pretty empty but , nice restaurant . The food was not worth the price this was definitely a miss : (
Rude customer service and always dirty . This is the reason people shop at tj maxx instead .
Yuck . Actual hamburger was paper thin . Chili was very greasy . Customer service was great . But I I ' ll stick to in - n - out .
Dirty facility ! Salad was wilted . Pizza was yucky ! I will not eat at this dirty restaurant again
I had the Thai iced tea and it had absolutely no flavour , it was almost like drinking water . The tapioca was the only good thing about the drink .
If you go during the day it takes forvevr to check out . They want you to spend the stupid wheel . Ugh I ' d rather go to a grocery store .
these guys are not trustworthy I recommend you go too another mechanic one guy gives one price and the other gives another price
It is ok but not the best I had before maybe because I make my own . For none Italian it might be great .
Terrible product ! I bought a belt for $ 1000 and it already falling apart ! Look nice at first ! Buyer beware ! Customer service got really bad when you try to return stuff !
Don ' t order " the big catch " entry . . . super salty and overcooked . Not impressed with this place at all .
Yet another overpriced novelty shop filled with cheap trinkets and curious smells . I ' m glad Smeeks is there rather than a McDonald ' s or something . But I wont ever buy anything there .
Had the pecan pesto chicken sandwich , the meat was so bland ! The worse was spending $ 10 on that . . came w some cold fries , we ordered fried zucchini nothing special about it
Customer service is a hit or miss here , but most of my experiences have been bad . I came here once and the employee didn ' t wash their hands before making my sandwich . Ew .
The rudest staff . Brittani ( staff member ) made my daughter cry . I have been to Peter Piper numerous times and will never come to this location again . Terrible staff .
Clean rooms but feels like the place is run by interns . 1 . 5 hrs to check - in after 3pm . Just stay at another Hilton brand hotel .
Food was good . The service was disappointing . Your better off going to Gallo where people actually care .
I can ' t even . . . . We finally left after unsuccessfully arguing that Grand Marnier is not mayonnaise .
Mediocre food and awful service . Messed up pizza order and manager was too much of a coward to even comment and just brought the credited receipt by and left . Won ' t be coming back
This location sucks when you ask for a blizzard Reese ' s or Oreo they are Skimpy they hardly put any in there might as well be a vanilla blizzard
Bleh . Bland , tasteless pizza , squishy pasta , watery sauce . The service was lackluster and the music is LOUD . Such a bummer , since it is so close to my house .
Beware . Dana Forte cannot be trusted . I ' d rather not go into specifics but you could certainly read through the other 127 review she has that only give her an average of two stars .
I ' ve had a ton of shabu shabu being from socal . This just wasn ' t good . The ingredients were not as tasty and fresh as I wanted .
Over price , dishonest , fixed things that don ' t need to be fixed . Same old Firestone quality across the country .
It ' s horrible pizza . Order four large pizzas and out of the four times I have gone the pizza is extremely greasy . If you like greasy pizza then go for it but its horrible .
I have had my daughter ' s car oil changed there regularly . I was always told they check all the fluids as well . That isn ' t true at all . Very disappointing .
The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional . Sat for 20min never came back to take our order . Food didn ' t taste good . It was too salty .
Golfed there today and must say it has to be in the worst shape of any golf course I have ever played . Which says a lot . Absolutely terrible .
Pros : helpful staff Cons : old casino , bad food
This was a great place for good food at a low price before the current owners took over . Bland food , doughy fish batter , breakfast is mediocre . Dont bother going .
The colors bother me . . . . really . Looks like a can of Chef Boyardee at Chuck E Cheeses .
Disgusting . Horrible . Don ' t go here , the days of Benihana are over , and naturally this place has followed the American tradition , charge the same and offer less quality .
Worst most unprofessional service department I ' ve dealt with . Don ' t waste your time here !
About the worst customer service I have ever had . I don ' t know Toby Keith personally but I can ' t imagine he would want his name associated with the kind of service I received .
Service was so slow and we asked for Thai hot on all our dishes and got mild on everything . Our local Thai joint called Thai Delight is 100 percent better ! Super bummed about this place
Overpriced because of being inside casino . $ 3 for a drink and he wanted to charge me for a refill .
Clean restaurant but food is very bland . This restaurant would not survive in Southern California where you can find REAL persian food .
Grass fed burger was rancid . Hot dog was old . Soda machines not working . Service was slow . Avoid at all costs .
Worst service ever ! ! I can only order 1 drink at a time for 2 people ? WTF ! ! ! How long em I in time out for ? Don ' t come here ! !
I came the other day for my ear piercing and I left with them uneven . The staff isn ' t friendly , lady sounded rude on the phone . Probably won ' t recommend this place
Rude people at this Avis location . They will continually authorize your credit card every two days that you have one of their cars not a very trusting place .
Their signature side is their made from scratch onion rings and the last two times I have visited they were out ! No excuse for this , can you imagine McDonald ' s running out of French Fries ?
Quality gone down and price went up . They no longer provide seasme seeds with plain rice roll , which is blasphemy in my dictionary !
Had a 3 sandwich order . They got 2 / 3 right . They accidently gave me pastrami instead of roast beef
Loud music . The atmosphere of the place wasn ' t for dinner or lunch for sure . The food was too spicy . Service was ok that ' s the only reason I gave one star .
My waiter was stoned ( slow gait , slanty eyes , forgot an item I ordered ) . Food was not spectacular .
Both dishes we ordered came out cold . They took one of the dishes we sent back and the served it to another customer ? ? ? Extremely unprofessional and would not recommend this place to anyone .
Awful service & undercooked food , actually got a refund because I couldn ' t eat my meal . I haven ' t gone back since , the Panera in Avon is now my go - to .
Good food but they use imitation crab in their rolls . For the price and marketing their " fresh seafood " , that ' s just shameful .
There was a fly . Baked into the cheese . Under the pepperoni . Luckily my friend hates pepperoni . Gross .
The only good thing about this dealership is Blake , my sales person . I will never go back to this dealership again . . .
Pedicure chairs were filthy instead of clean it they used a plastic bag . Coffin nails shaped horribly . NEVER GO HERE . Worse technicians EVER
Waited in line , asked to be seated in the patio area in front of the store , hostess decided to give the table to someone else , that was not cool
Out of BUFFALO SAUCE for the chicken melt BUFFALO Sandwhich WHAAAAAA this Sandwhich is what I crave when aunt flow comes to visit !
Tried to stop by for quick late snack but the order of 3 plain slices took forever to come out .
Sorely disappointed about this bistro . The food was mostly OK , but the price didn ' t match up to the quality / value of the food . Definitely overpriced for what you get .
It ' s a 24 hour McDonald ' s but that service after midnight is the slowest ever experienced
Awful . Just awful . I have both worked for this company and lived on properties they patrol . Horrible in both suits .
Really slow service . Mediocre food that is pricey . Love the bakery , but the bistro is not worth the money . I had the Croque Monsieur and the omelette du jour . both were just okay .
Been there twice . First time my burger was overdone . There again this week and my medium well was bloody ! Not happy !
I probably won ' t ever go to another one of theses restaurants I ' d much rather go to an authentic Asian restaurant with cheaper prices and better quality food . This place is shit .
Produce section is too big . Would prefer a smaller produce section with fresher fruits and veggies instead of an huge , empty produce section full of sub par produce that goes rotten in two days .
Definitely not all it ' s was made to be by watching the show shark tank . I was disappointed very bland . But great staff really friendly and clean establishment
This place is gross and dirty . We spent $ 600 to roll in dirt . Never will we return and yes we will warn others .
Its truly awful . Wonton soup looked and tasted like dirty dish water . Id give it negative stars if i could .
Yelp please update your times . I came to 3 locations because your app advised me of them being opened at 10 and they are not ! Thank you for waisting my time .
Wasn ' t a fan , food was pretty bland . Salsa was horrible more than likely i would never go back to this place again .
Service is mediocre and the people there are very rude . Stay away . Too many other good nail places around .
I waited forever . $ 10 glass of wine . I hate places that give you crumbs and charge premium prices . The portions were so small . My poke was literally the size of a large coin .
These apartments are vastly overpriced for their cheap build quality , constantly require maintenance from a management team that doesn ' t know what they are doing .
Horrible service ! ! We had to walk out because the lady didn ' t stop chatting with a customer , when she had few people waiting on her ! ! !
Worst hotel ever , smells disgusting , horrible customer service , pool was closed and its tiny anyways . Never staying there again . No shuttle service , no ice machines available . Zero stars .
How frustrating service department ! 201Escalade has bad transmission been in on and off for weeks still not working ! Run around lots of talk , take it back ! Sadly it ' s not going better !
Food is bland and dry . Only thing that was decent was the red sangria . Place was dirty and unsanitary
Ordered from skip the dishes . The small portions are a waste of money . I can get more bang for my buck from mucho burrito . Tacos were bland and unappetizing .
I went there with my family food was horrible took like 10 mins for the waitress to get me a refill then for desert I got angle food cake it was hard as a rock .
First time ordering from her and I got the Aloo Gobi and Channa Masala . My aloo Gobi didn ' t just have a hair in it a whole HAIR BALL ! Not going back .
People were nice , but overall not very consistent . The roving wasn ' t consistent either . My nails fell off 3 days later . Wouldn ' t recommend this place .
If you are looking to get sick you found that right place ! The food is horrible ! Low quality and bad service !
La nourriture n ' était pas extraordinaire ! Il manquait de saveur . Le chocolat trop sucré !
Staff is unfriendly but the sandwiches are pretty good . Only go if you have to , otherwise I ' m sure you can find a better place to eat around town .
The food and service were both great . But the hidden extra 18 % on the bill ruined it . We were going give her 20 % until we spotted it on the check .
No massage with your pedicure I even paid and extra $ 5 for a salt scrub and still no massage . . Never coming back .
Bad service . Again . No condiments that I asked for . No refills . Server is an idiot . No apology for forgetting us . And not busy at all .

This league is so unorganized ! ! I will probably let me kids play in another league next season .
We ordered whopper meals . Both meals COLD . Frys cold . Burger cold . Best head to . . any place in the area for dinner . Cheat day fail
There ' s not much more to say than has already been said . Worst restaurant experience ever . I ' ve learned my lesson and will check Yelp from now on !
Great place , delish food and cool music , but they totally have to reconsider about the waitress whom they hire . It was for the second time I was there and surprisingly she ' s still there .
The food is dry , the staff inexperienced and the service is horrible . Disgusting ! ! Enough said .
My daughter loves it , but I cannot stand the food , the noise , or the horrible parking .
Took almost one hour to get our dinner . They were just their plate meals . Don ' t come here if you are hungry .
Over rated and over priced ! Food was bland and lacked any kind of flavor . Such a disappointment . Go somewhere else . This place is not worth it .
4 / 1 / 13 , had broken glass called twice monday morning , phone service the worst , put on hold several minutes , got phone robots and then disconnected . went to Ryans next no problem .
They ran out of water and said we had to go to the vending machine . Not very nice customer service and not compatible . Our bedding had blood stains . Do not stay here !
$ 20 for a plate of over cooked spaghetti topped with bits of dry truffle . Bone marrow is supposed to be served piping hot , not just warm . Baguette bread was stale .

Aweful service ! ! Unbelievable . All nail techs are chinese with poor English . They all chit chat in their language all the time while serving customers . Stay away .
The restaurant is small and most of the menu are like fast food . We just wanna sit there and enjoy some spicy food . Unfortunately , we didnt have a chance to try
Overpriced food and beverage . Inattentive staff and not family friendly despite being in a family oriented neighborhood . Think they made a mistake opening in this locale . Probably better suited in a more urban environment .

Bad service , even worse food . Everything looks dirty . Food was under cooked . Area is horrible and staff gossip all day next to your table due to tiny environment .

This is for the terminal 1 d gates . Tiny . I grabbed a coffee and left . They had some danishes and small snack packs and cup of soup , but the place was so dang small .

Had laser treatment done for vein removal on my face . Treatment resulted in blisters , horrible scars around my nose and the veins are still there .
Not that impressive for the price . 2 yogurts for $ 24 is excessive . Be careful , the yogurt machines dispense FAST .
Not worth the money . The food are horrible . The service are bad too . The second star I gave it to the lady did a show for us on making the cotton candy .

Very mediocre Mexican . Tacos were pretty bland and over priced .
We ordered the strawberry and mango bonbon series and i have to say I ' m quite dissapointed . The drinks are not worth the price of $ 13 .
This place has really gone downhill . Ate there last friday . Waitress had no clue about menu . Could not ring drinks in properly . Food was okay but service was below mediocre
Poor selection ( most are fuddy - duddy mommy clothes ) , grossly overpriced and the whole store smells like old shoes . This definitely won ' t be on my rounds .
Un Apple store assez joli , spacieux , où le personnel ( bilingue ) y est accueillant mais parfois peu disponible .
Very high price for a good burger with crapy fries ( maybe that ' s why they give a huge amount of them ) & no other options except for the fries .
Worst taco bell I ' ve ever been in . Had to wait ten minutes for food . Trash everywhere , they gave food to me on trays that were soaking wet .
Coffee and Donuts milkshake was great , our burgers were not . Barely any cheese or sauce and my " pink " burger was dry and burnt . Try BRGR ! They have excellent food !
Do not use ! ! This guy come to replace my toilet and gave me a price for $ 1056 This is crazy . Not cool I found someone else to do it for me for $ 250
Charlotte location is closed for business . I went there tonight without thinking to check their actual website to see what locations are open .

This place is small , but cheap . With all the other options around Las Vegas , I don ' t see the reason to come here unless you REALLY need to save the extra dollar or two .

Urgent care needs more then 2 doctors on a Sunday ! Really , Really slow service . Next time , I ' ll Go elsewhere : - ( .
Deep Dish pizza in general just tastes like too much sauce on a piece of flat pizza bread . The flavours were good but it was just so much sauce and so heavy . . . . .
I found 2 hairs in my salad . My souvlaki dinner was way overpriced - I ' d rather walk to Eaton Centre and hit up Jimmy the Greek in the food court than come here ever again .
Interesting concept , poorly executed . Ordering shouldn ' t be confusing or difficult , menu should be representative of what you have to offer .
Worst McDonalds In the world , probably not . But I will give them an A + for trying to be worst .
The wings wasn ' t that great . Other then that delivered on time and very polite delivery guy .

Literally save your time and go to Dutch Bros . It took FORTY minutes for me to get two drinks today . It would have taken maybe 10 at any other Starbucks store in the valley .
Get rid of the new dude . There was two drinks to be made a head of me and it took him 15 mins to complete the order . This can ' t happen guys come on .
They take forever and almost ALWAYS get my order wrong . I ' ve been in the line for 20 minutes - HAVEN ' T EVEN PAID YET . . .
Action comics and sports ? Then in the pictures all you see is lil board gamers . Most comic shop nowadays call themselves a comic shop then you walk in rarely will you see comics

This location on the strip is gone , there is a taco place instead . Mad Greek is off strip up Sahara now

If they want to sell clothes for working women , why don ' t they set their hours accordingly ?

The technician that did my nails did ask to give me a 20 % discount for the wait time .
Flat beer & undercooked food , McDonalds & Shomars are a definite step up . Management never visited the table even after food was sent back , obviously the employees take notice and don ' t care either .
Blah . . . . that ' s all that needs to be said . I ' m not sure if we ate at the same place because the food I got was super bland and over all gross
First apt took 40 min to get in room . Today I have been sitting here almost an hour and still in main waiting room . It ' s like our time doesn ' t matter .

Great sushi , terrible customer service . They should consider stepping up their game since a brand new sushi place opened right across the street . Will NOT be coming back .
This place used to be good years ago but its gone down a steep hill . The shawarma toppings are not fresh and the spreads are tasteless . Not worth the value .
Just some regular white people cuisine . Nothing you can ' t make at home . Shows how lazy those people are .
Don ' t eat their food . I got food poisoning in March 2016 from their food . Bonnie said she would credit my Discover Card payment but she never did . Dishonesty and poor food hygiene .
Mediocre at best poor service and I engaged employees . I ' ll take my business elsewhere .
The Arizona Republic fails to deliver local and national news effectively . Articles are biased and difficult to follow .
Old lao food . I dont recommend this place . Would never come back here . Seems like all the hot food has been sitting there for days and they just microwave for you when u order

The only good thing I can say about this place is the bean dip is good . Cold food , no flavor , and crappy service .
Food is pretty good . Service is sub par . Empty glasses all around our table and an overall confusion as to who is waiting on us ( if anyone ) .

If you like grill , greasy hashbrowns and chewy cheese in your omelette , go here ! ! Also , Theresa ; waitress , should really find a job she likes .

Pretty bad . My faucet was leaking and after 4 plumbers it is still leaking . They have done several repairs but none of them seem to work .
I can ' t rate lower , if I could I would . That beach at the door has the personality of a mule . Pun intended for the atmosphere .
This McDonald ' s gave me old ass cold fries . I ' m done going to any McDonald ' s , it ' s always a bad experience
An aging starlet fades as her frequently changing management neglects the sparkle that once made her great . . . .
Good was disappointing , bread was flavorless , service was incredibly slow . Patio is lovely but doesn ' t make up for the slow service .
Too over price and service is so bad . We wait for the Peking duck for 1hr and even ask for the water we need to wait for 15 min ! One time only , not coming back !
first time there today my wife ' s birthday waited patiently for 15 min . for our server . He never came to the table so we left . I was looking forward to tasting the food .
The food is ok but the lunch service is incredibly slow !
An hour wait when there was no one in the restaurant . Really . . . . . I ' ll take my money elsewhere and not to the slot machines .
Sooooooo Rude at checkin by Rae second time I have encountered this from her . Oh and I ' ve been here 2 1 / 2 hours to give a pee sample !
Hair in the food , not mine . Ewwwwwwww disgusting . Do not recommend . How does this have 4 stars on yelp ? Lol
Extra sauce apparently means = zero sauce . This is not the first time and I ' m pretty p * ssed . Fix your employment or management .

The icing on the petite cakes was complete garbage . Very dry and distasteful . Do not recommend . Ruined my night ! ! ! !
deli is super slow . Nobody in front of me Employees standing around Unfriendly employees Plastic bag ripped at cashier , didn ' t even offer to re bag .
Expensive gelato and not great flavours with meh taste . I ' ve had way better gelato in Toronto .
Sushi was OK but not really worth going back for , atmosphere like a diner . I prefer a place with more variety and character .
Fast service but the blonde older lady was very rude to my 2 year old daughter . She seemed like a miserable lady .
Had come a couple at times they always rushing to order and with attitude . like the product but they need to get better customer service
Save yourself the hassle & go somewhere else . Dr came off extremely unprofessional , rude staff , zero communication .
I went to this Urgent Care last Jan . Terrible experience . They take your money and don ' t do nothing for you . Rude people .
Longest waste of time at a car wash ever . Not even clean and waited more than 40 minutes .
The service is crap ( although they try hard ) , the food is shoddy , and the wait is always long .
Sold out of literally everything we wanted to try . Paid $ 6 for coffee , although it wasnt bad .
There are some employees that are really rude and disrespectful and my ice cream is always melted before I even get to eat it they have one job like honestly .
Seriously underwhelmed . Great location on the strip but goes downhill fast . Bad margaritas . Very bland food . Overpriced because of the location . With all the Vegas food options , avoid this place .
rudest most incompetant front staff of any office ive ever experienced . love the doctor but will be going to another practice with qualified well mannered front staff .
Terrible food , dingy atmosphere a must miss . I could not believe the bill considering the quality of the food .
Took a long time for the food to come , customer service was ok , and there was a bug on the food but the waiter did not care
Most buildings do their renovations during the summer . . . but not Wampler . Also , I ' ve never seen anyone get an environmental ticket . Pick up your trash wampler , this is URBANA !
Waited 35 minutes for a crepe . Not impressed with savory crepes . Seemed unorganized , but servers were friendly .
Sushi has an odd taste to it . Some people apparently like it , but I don ' t . I ' ve given them several chances . Not going back .
Service just sucks , food is nothing close to any of the newer KBBQ in town , I really don ' t understand the hype and how they got so many reviews . Awesome .
Warm Red wine in wrong glass . . . Smallish pour . . . Guess this flys in Champaign , near Chicago they ' d be closed . Didn ' t try the food after the wine experience .
Worst slowest service of my life , wasted an hour here . Overpriced too . Not gonna be coming back .
Cannot get help . Waited 20 minutes for you to unlock the cologne . Time to head to Macy ' s
Very fast service however dropped off an important letter and the customer rep just left it out on the counter
It ' s just OK . Size of tacos is small and meat inside almost non - existent . You end up eating lettuce . Way over priced .
Food is below expectations and the place is dirty . Seen people come in from taking out trash and walking in with out washing their hands . Its gross
Service is slow . Took 20mins to get beef brisket noodle served . When arrived , the beef was still cold inside .
Too inconsistent for me . Crust tends to be overcooked so if like that , this is the place . Ingredients are fine , especially the sausage . NYC atmosphere is interesting and seating area small but adequate .
The staff was super rude . They gave attitude . Would never eat here again . We asked to speak with the manager and they said he want there but he was .
Came on a tour bus . Save the trouble and go to TGI Friday . Very limited selection on food . Didn ' t expected to be like this since I been to other Vegas buffet .
Mike wouldn ' t take me and a service dog . My dog is probably cleaner than your car ! !
This diner was a disappointment . The food was bad and it was too expensive . Not going back .
Got really ripped off here . Nice rooftop bar , and only good served there is bucket of chicken . F me for not checking the price . Six pieces for $ 35 .
Slow service , sub par food . Shouldn ' t have to wait 15 minutes in an empty store for a single order . Won ' t be coming back .
Im sorry for those folks who wait for over one hour to dine at the creepiest place ever . . . In one of the fanciest casinos in Las Vegas . Food was tasteless and service was descriminate .
Disappointing experience after almost a year since the last time I was here . Ingredients weren ' t fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices .
Stopped in an hour and a half before they closed , and they had zero cupcakes . Disappointing .
Buying Online , you choose the tires that you want , schedule a appointment . when you get to the store the tires that you are buying online they have been discontinue false advertisement
So dirty . Would not come back unless it ' s a last resort . Employees were loud and facility was gross and smelled musty .
A very busy lunch time location . Veggies aren ' t always the freshest here . They serve old bread . Good customer service is hit and miss . They definitely need to give this location some TLC .
The food ' s presentation and the ambiance are outstanding , but the food themselves are just plain and boring .
Calamari was chewy . Flat bread was bland . Wait staff was grumpy . Margarita was $ 10 and not good . Not impressed .
Ordinary service , and 45 minutes for a simple lunch . Really need to work on restaurant ventilation , I know smell like oil . . .
My picture looked better than how it tasted . The gyro meat wasn ' t very flavorful . I ended up throwing most of it away . Bummer !
So I pay $ 90 per month and twice now I can not gain access to my own storage unit . Please stay away from this place . Customer service is the worse here .
Did you used to be a man ? ! What I overheard at the bar . Child present in the bar . F - bombs flying by staff . Drinks with my favorite daughter with entertainment .
You ' re going to need a tetanus and possibly an STD test once you ' re done staying here b / c you can tell that nothing has been cleaned . Ever .
Not exactly the best lounge . Stinky , over crowded n limited selection of food . Free drinks were they only thing . . But those were bottom shelf drinks .
Please do not waste your time here . They measure their ice cream scoops . And the manager is very rude .
The food and service were wonderful here in the 1990 ' s . I would not reccomend this restaurant anymore to anyone . ESPECIALLY the brunches . Overcooked omelettes and steaks beyond tough . Sad . . .
Unbelievable ! My friend loses a PS4 , probably in the way truck going to storage place !
So I was here by myself . While everyone around me got complimentary chips and guacamole I got none . The food was so small in portion and tasted awful . Def won ' t come back .
The pizza was soggy and didn ' t taste that great . The restaurant was also dirty and the servers were not attentive .
sadly to say the unicorn closed like a week ago . didn , t see it comming . but they will be missed .
This BK stinks like throw up and shit . Their burgers were bland and not so tasty at all .
Terrible service , won ' t fix a problem in a timely manner , and they are not apologetic . I do not recommend this to anyone . Water delivery drivers are also rude .
This place needs to be shut down . I havent been to a grosser place since the cecil was in its last days .
Claim Jumper is a Hieronymus Bosch painting come to life .
Not worth it at all . The kimchi fried rice was sour . The food is overpriced and the service was just okay .
A lot of construction and only a few good choices in Concorde A . CAK seems a lot better to me .
One of the worst shisha places in toronto . I think they closed down because this place is literally empty all the time . I feel so sad to see this great location go to waste .
Tried it once would never go back , food was beyond horrible and made me and my friend sick . Don ' t waste your money , lots of better options out there .
Every burger overcooked and all sides were cold after a 40 minute wait . Burgatory ? I think not . BEWARE DO NOT EAT HERE ! ! ! ! ! !
This place has bad service . They are very snobby and need to be released trained in customer care . I will not recommend anyone to go there
I ordered chicken katsu and the chicken is soooo not crispy . The curry sauce is spicy and sour , unlike those japanese curry sauce which is supposed to be sweet : (
way too over priced . And unwilling to realize and discuss . Other places MUCH better then this . Plus : rummaging through their junk jewelry ~
The squid was not edible and the oxtail fries were like prison slop . The beer and pho were great . Stick to that !
Stood at the register waiting to pay for my online order for over 10 mins while two employees stood right by me , talking and leaning on the counter .
This place doesn ' t even exist anymore . . . Why is the mall advertising it and Yelp ? Wasted my time looking around for it at the mall . . . . Epic fail
Typical sports bar , loud , bar food , reasonable beer prices . Service has been good both times I have been . Bar food ugh . Go if you want a drink .
5 : 20 am rang their buzzer to be let in no answer so left was a group of 8 so we just found somewhere else
Soso food , bad service , $ 7 beers . Yet another " Irish " bar . Skip this one until they come under better management .
Very small portion Chinese food / Taste good / $ 100 + feels like eat nothing / wasting time for food /
My friend asked for a side of tapioca balls , the waitress called him weird . Rude ass waitress with no customer service skills .
The staff is horribly unkind , rude . . the worst that I ' ve ever seen .
Can this place get an order correct the 1st time ? I think not !
Sat there for 15 minutes without a waitress bringing a menu . Gave up and went to Lone Star Grill .
Went last night . After about 15 minutes and not one laugh my wife and looked at each other and decided to leave . Got our tickets off of ' House Seats ' so no loss there .
This is definitely one of the cheapest places to get gas that I can find . I drive all over the the valley and they are usually the cheapest . Bathrooms could use some service
Poor taste and meat quality . Koreans will not like this place . Worst food experience for $ 70 . 00 . All the Asian food has been adjusted to be suitable for American taste .
Just had a veggie omelette with two link sausage . 14 . 50 $ add a three dollar tip and that ' s 17 . 50 $ for eggs and sausage ? It was good but kinda !
Meatballs are horrible , obviously frozen , pasta was like mush . Is this what the serve on the streets of ny , I think not .
Very nice staff , food was not the best . I did come in pretty late around 2am . There was a live singer , not sure if it was karaoke .
This Chipotle is terrible . Sloppy assembly of food , SLOW service and poor attitude describe the staff . Go to the Chipotle in Legacy instead .
Left after it took way too long to get drinks then was told only dinner option for me was spaghetti . Everything else had meat and their veggie burgers are awful .
Very bad experience . I had the Special Platter . The bread ( Pav ) was spoiled and smelly . I am sure something in the Raita was not fresh either .
Unreal order dinner for the family and this was the kids spaghetti there was nothing there . . last time we ordered a To go the salads had no kids no dressing . . disappointing
Don ' t waste your time . If you ' re going to spend , spend your money on something worth eating ! ! !
It is a ridiculous waste of time going to this El Pollo Loco . They are out of chicken EVERY time we go there .
Go to Coras next door . This place always has all these flies crawling on the pizzas . . . . . . . . it ' s seriously disgusting
This is the weakest club I have ever been too . . . All the females were too skinny and scared to money . . . Don ' t waste your time nor money . . . .
The menu definitely oversells the ' Chicken and Waffle ' dish , describing it as spicy fried chicken on waffles with maple syrup . . . in reality you get four regular plain wings on a waffle .
They got the hell part right . One of the absolute worst places I ' ve ever been . Would rather stab myself in the eyes with scissors than ever go back .
Would not recommend . Unfriendly staff and the quality of work is sub - par . For the price , I would save your money and find an alternative .
I really like this pub but the food is not great and everytime I go there they have karaoke which is annoying . Ban the karoke and i would give this place a 4 / 5
The food is not good at all . Delivery took over an hour and we live not even a mile away . I wouldn ' t eat here ever again .
It ' s old and smells off ! Always have to wait in long lines to check out AND NO SELF CHECK OUT ! Never been impressed with Basha but this is one of their low end stores .
Slowest chipotle I have ever been to . They can ' t figure out how to incorporate online orders into the line and struggle when the place is full . Avoid if you ' re in a rush .
We had dinner at this place , food taste was below our expectation . We had Dal , paneer gravy was sweet when we specially mentioned I dont like sweet .
Taxi driver stole iphone 5 . Stay away from this company ! ! !
Outrageously expensive ice cream . Ordered butter pecan . Guess what ? ? NO PECANS in butter pecan ice cream , not one .
I used to go here a lot . Now it ' s way too smokey . I thought they had to have a partition or something .
Terrible service ! Too slow to prepare table ! It took 30minutes to complete the order . It ' s unacceptable ! !
Food is bad and overpriced . I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone . I had lamb last night and was mainly bone and the only meat was completely dry as if it was prepared weeks ago
Pretty sure I just got food poisoning from there . It was the only thing I had to eat . BEWARE
Expect a long wait . They have one associate for the entire store . Hope that the customers before you aren ' t elderly that have the worker do a step - by - step demonstration and setup .
Poppy seed buns were stale . Tatertots were way over cooked . $ 16 for 2 hotdogs and tots = too expensive for what I got
We went there after a Pirate game . They had only one bartender and one wait staff . Couldn ' t even order food , due to the understaffing . The management there should be fired .
A lot has changed and this place is less of a sports bar and more of a biker bar . Food is still bad , service sucks and is ' nt worth a visit .
20 minutes in line on a Sunday . The birthday party will be over soon and my seven year old is still waiting for shoes . As if we needed a reminder of why nobody bowls anymore .
Always double check your order if getting take out . I have yet to see them get an order right .
Terrible dealership , very poor customer service along with the most over priced under experienced service department . Beware you ' ve been warned Stay away from the service department
I did not enjoy the lunch buffet . There wasn ' t as much variety as I ' ve seen at other Las Vegas buffets and the quality was poor .
Ordered a large pizza and cinnamon knots . Pizzas was just okay . Cinnamon knots would of been good had they not forgot the icing and a knot . Would not recommend .
The bartenders here were very disrespectful . Bad customer service . They lost my business . After this I wouldn ' t come back to this establishment under any circumstances .
Food was good . Expensive . But the reason I gave 1 star is that the chief was rude . Rude as in asking unnecessary questions .
After being repeat customers we had the worst experience with customer service . Since that time we have not been back and will not return .
Would be fine if they didn ' t try to steal my bank card . I ' ll never go back in know a shady place when I see one .
Great coffee . Cafe looks terrible . It doesn ' t send the image of a coffeehouse . Sterile and cold like a hospital .
Particularly bad food in a neighborhood that sells good food . Weird unseasoned fish tacos and bitter plaintain chips . Yuck . I would not return .
Very POOR customer service , the young girls at this tiny salon are extremely rude . Will NEVER visit this place again !
The waiter had poor service , and was too busy tending too a female all night than too wait people . There was several people trying to get the bartenders attention and was very unsuccessful .
The food sucks . Worst coleslaw I ' ve ever tasted . There are so many other restaurants in Vegas that are better . "
Horrible ! ! Everything taste the same and leaves your tongue numb . I ordered 2 dishes and they were ready in 5 mins so nothings cooked fresh just reheated
Didn ' t bring any plates , napkins or anything . Delivery driver was somewhat rude . He didn ' t even have to deliver it to our hotel room we walked down ourselves
Mothers Day brunch was a disaster , poor service no food . We waited for over an hour for our order , and when part of it showed up it looked like a child ' s portion .
I ' ve used them two times . Both times the service was fine but the customer service was terrible . Rude technicians . Rude dispatchers .
Why they need to take down the to Arby ' s listings on East Tropicana and South Maryland Parkway they are both closed down
Have been here twice an food is mediocre @ best and quite overpriced . Nice setting . Service was good . Unfortunately the service and environment did not make up for the quality of the food and price .
This place is 100 % awful . Bad service , substandard food . . . a lot to pay for lame Chinese if you ' re not getting it comped . Do NOT come here .
Don ' t arrive 15min before closing , they ' ll seat you and no one will help you . The service here SUCKS !
Great beer selection Cute servers . Food sucks Oh well u can ' t have it all i guess
Spots missing cheese - Crust not all the way cooked . : (
Yep . I ' m glad I never moved my important accounts to Goldwater Highly disappointed .
They did not even know what turquoise was . Extremely limited inventory . And the people were incredibly rude .
This location has mastered the art of no customer service . The employees must be trained not to smile and avoid all eye contact . The wait for coffee here is loong . . . . .
Well it ' s incredibly cheap , but it ' s still garbage that you ' re ingesting . . . slow service all the taps are dirty as hell .
Love their food , hate their prices , too much for too little food . Not worth it as the specialty is really in their sauce .
Horrible customer service . Employee made an error and manager refused to speak with me . This deserves a 0 .
Took 20 minutes for 10 wings . And then they weren ' t cooked long enough and they were lacking in flavor . Not worth it at all .
Over priced small dingy flat bagels ‼‼‼‼ not worth it . . . if your a new Yorker stay away . . . this place will make you cry I know ‼‼‼
This Target is terrible at line control . Always a 10 minute wait at check out with 2 lines .
We purchased a band for an open bar . The bartender literally openly ignored us . Worse bartender ever with crappy attitude . Still sober .
Really poor service . Food is ok . Orders never arrive . You should probably avoid this place .
Cheap in every aspect except the cost ! Will never return . Bleh .
Too expensive for hotdogs . Not meeting expectation even adding with cheese . Not a place to chat or study . Not considering coming back again , I would rather have burgers or hotdogs at five guys .
Two visits in one trip , first and last . Food so so at best , ok if you are hungry but don ' t drive out if your way ,
Waiters were terrific . Food left a lot to be desired . My soup was good but the Caesar was bland and flavorless .
My mouth felt like a cotton ball after eating here , someone needs to lay off the salt . . . . .
Third time I get food poisoning from this place . Gave it the benefit of the doubt but I ' m now 10 000percent sure that it was their food that made me sick
Need better customer service . Placed a phone order for pizza & lady employee was very rude . C ' mon Bashas we can do better !
Very rude customer service the guy at the NARS counter was no help and he didn ' t know anything about the products .
Worse pharmacy ever ! ! ! Rude ! ! ! When they say an hour wait which usually means 2 hours ! ! Going back to CVS
The Unicorn has finally closed due to that damn condo going up at Redpath / Eglinton - we literally watched it be bulldozed from my balcony . RIP Unicorn , you will be missed !
Please do use this practice . I ' ve had such a terrible experience . I would not wish on my worst enemy .
Sushi was good but got incredibly small amounts for outrageous prices and crazy slow service . Really mad at this place .
Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can ' t see the food on your plate . Underwhelming and overpriced .
Don ' t order the gluten free . Obviously they don ' t know that you have to bake the crust first ! Under the cheeses my pizza had the consistency of oatmeal ! Yuck !
An average - quality cheeseburger and fries , at an above average price . I could have bought a steak burger for $ 10 .
Not impressed . Really just a concept restaurant with meh food and kitschy decor . OK as a local bar hangout and no more . So many other options especially on Monroe St !
Was really good but lost it goodness . Still friendly but breakfast went downhill . Potatoes really greasy , fruits dry , servers getting order wrong . . . what happened ! Used to be great ,
We had such poor service . Never did place and order because it took so long just to get our water . And waitress never did show up . We ended up leaving and going to a different restaurant
Went here - place closed . Looks like remodeling or ? ? ? ? No sign . Tried calling . . . . oh well off to The Guys Pies !
Hate this dominos ! They never have online ordering available and when you try calling , they hang up on you ! ! They are always understaffed and the staff they do have is rude .
At Home used to be our go to place for home decor because it WAS cheap stuff cheap . Now it seems they raised prices but not quality .
The restaurant is big , clean and has lots of seating . The food is just okay , nothing special . Not worth going back for .
Horrible customer service . On hold for over an hour . . . then hung up on , only to be told to call the other Walgreens
SO . DAMN . RUDE . Why ? We were so excited to find an open buffet , and the staff could not have been more abrupt or contemptuous . Disappointing .
Personally didn ' t enjoy the taste too much . It was way too overwhelming in sweetness n had a weird coconut taste .
Nothing good about this place . Atmoshere , service , food , even the water was bad . I would be embarresed to run an establishment like this
I have contacted Midas customer service line 2x and they still haven ' t contacted me . Seems to be terrible cyst service throughout the organization .
First time going there and i will not be going back . Waitress took forever to get our orders . Bugs in the drinks and waitress didn ' t bring us silverware or napkins . Never again !
Terrible . It took 1 1 / 2 hours to get a shuttle and go 4 miles to The Palazzo . Save yourself and get a taxi .
Save yourself the hassle and do not order from this business . The owner is totally unprofessional and unreliable . Just take a look at the reviews on Yelp and BBB .
Avoid ! Customer service so so but the food was awful . Having lived in Chi Town I can assure you that their Chicago dog was far from authentic . Their cheese steak was a totally overpriced joke .
The wait here to see the doctor is very long and if you want to see a specific Dr they get mad . Dr maduka has a poor bedside manner
Sangria has more ice than alcohol , what a rip off . Overall environment is good , good sports etc , but the sangria is overpriced for the amount we got .
Mediocre at best but when you are hungry and too lazy to drive anywhere else give this place a try .
I bought a groupon and it was 48 $ for 90 minutes . The massages was 60 minutes and when I brought it up the message therapist she just ignored me
Came to this location and was told they were closed because someone had broke their window . . Kinda suck that someone would do that . . But not totally sure how that caused them to close . .
Not the best breakfast sandwich . No ketchup . Service ok . . . expensive for quality . . . but nothing else around so stuck : (
Get a Manager that understand demand . This place is a ghetto trash nightmare . I have never been in a worse grocery store in my life .
THIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED ! The Pasta Shop took over the location , which is a huge upgrade .
Was bored and this was the only place I could think of to go . I need to make better choices in the future .
Semi sketch store They have an " OK " selection but not much Customer service is okay too Nothing much to write about
The food is very good But having it served by a fellow with long hair and long beard is not . . . I am pretty sure that is not in compliance with health department
After a long drive , we were looking forward to steak and eggs . It looked promising . The food was lukewarm . The food was bland .
Bad taste , almost every - single - item . Looked not good presentation . Other customers didn ' t like it . Planet hollywood buffet was very good
The rice was dry . The curry was alright . My boyfriend got the fried rice and it had no taste whatsoever .
Let me just say , " Breakfast saved the stay . "
$ 20 maker mark manhattans ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! Outrageous prices . I ' ve been here before and never paid that much even on the strip .
Unprofessional . Lazy service . I had a reservation and they act like they couldn ' t pull up a extra chair or table to accommodate my party .
Not sure if they moved or closed , but they are gone with no signage . Too bad . Was a great place to browse !
This the least expensive fuel in northwest Las Vegas . Clean facility with good service in store .
Worst restaurant ever ! took 2 hrs to get 2 burgers ! felt sick half way through the wait and went home to the doctor and realized i caught strep throat from this restaurant !
Always excited to home to visit and completely let down this past time . Service is lacking , food . . ok
3 words : disgusting , disgusting , and fucking disgusting . Oh wait , that was 4 .
Quite possibly the worst service I have ever encountered here in Las Vegas , and that ' s saying something . Use anybody else . Anybody .
Service was terrible . The kids there looked like their job was the most painful thing they had to do . I ' ll do port of subs before I deal with punk teenagers again .
There are two listings for Taj . Here and Taj Indian Cuisine & Banquet Hall . Since there are no reviews here I suggest you look for the others and read before you visit .
I live on king street and i have found a better cleaner near queen and bathurst thx
Severe stomach ache after a tasteless lunch , very disappointing And would never attempt again . Bread was dry , meat was dry .
Still one star due to inefficient staff and long wait times . The line was snaked around the store and they only had 2 cashiers . They clearly don ' t care about customers .
I ordered a small real deal pizza for delivery . The pizza dough was raw & undercooked . Can ' t say that I will be a repeat customer after this experience .
They were training people and it took 20 minutes to get my one drink . Very disappointing . I won ' t be coming back to this location .
Worst drive thru ever ! ! ! ! Haven ' t moved in 15 minutes ! ! C ' mon ! Really ? ! ? ! ? Get it together !
It ' s just not right Thai Food / Vietnamese combine ? Thai food just doesn ' t go with it
Rude staff and way overpriced . Room service took over an hour to deliver breakfast , which was cold .
had breakfast there . thought it was better than sitting in dusk inside . terrible eggs , artificial orange juice . expensive
Let me sum it up : Food is horrible , mac and cheese was runny , poor service , got a medium mac and cheese I opened it it was basically a small .
Waiteress and all where nice . The food was cold and overpriced . We didn ' t even order that much food . Won ' t be going back there again .
Have to agree with some of the earlier post . Total mess right now with construction . Not real friendly or well marked either . Arrive early ! !
The Convention Center needs better souvenir store / vendor . Everything looked old and used . Not a lot of souvenirs to pick . Poor souvenir store . Need major improvement .
A week later and no response from the general manager . This clearly indicates that management could care less about their patrons within their establishment . Will not be returning ! !
They run low on items such as bagels and serve much more slowly than their Northern counterparts . May be just growing pains as they ' ve only been open 2 months .
The attention is poor they are very slow . Today wait more than 25 minutes and attended in drive thu before the customer inside of the store . They excused themselves that they were forgotten .
Worn out . Many games broken . Food not great and pricey . Not impressed but my kids had fun . . . they are only 7 and 9 years old .
This place sucks ass . The line doesn ' t seem to move and the workers don ' t seem to care about how slow they are .
If you are just one person they will put you in the worst seating . Even when I politely asked for other seating I was refused . Ah well - GREAT sushi next door .
Located in old town Las Vegas . . . Everything is old , yet cheap here . Don ' t like how you must have a reservation here in order to park free in their parking lot .
Slow service 7 days a week . Guys hire some more people ? ! ? Managers get out front and help out your tellers .
Reason for two stars is I went there to order a breakfast sandwich ( egg , avocado , tomato , cream cheese ) and they gave me the wrong order .
I hate it when I eat in at an establishment and they make it to go . Like 5 guys . I don ' t care how good it looks or tastes , that ' s just tacky .
We have been waiting 30 plus minutes for our food and still not here yet ! This is for dining in too ! God knows how long take out is ! !
I have eaten here many times and love the food but today ' s service was horrible ! Hire more staff and smile ladies ! I probably won ' t be back for a while .
Says open till midnight everyday and it ' s closed dang I really wanted to get my nails done oh well by the way it ' s 10 : 48pm
Terrible and inconsistent customer service . Made promises that they didn ' t meet and blamed it all on a rep that they fired .
Incredibly rude staff and awful food . Not much more needs to be said . Don ' t go here , tell your friends not to go here .
They keep on calling us , we asked for quote once and now 10 calls a day . Seems like a mom and pop shop , and very disorganized .
Save yourself and your wallet ; avoid this over price placed . Would ' ve been better off going next door to the dollar store and getting a bag of cat food .
Very , Very Expensive . Good Service but Overpriced . I would have been better off going to a local Mom & Pop Company . Their service calls are at a premium .
i have never eaten anything worse than this , it dose even taste like food and the service is so bad . the owner there just kept ignoring me .
Came this morning . . . they weren ' t open at 10 : 00 am they didn ' t open the doors till 10 : 05 . Also was greeted by this cockroach . Pretty gross .
The owner has stop serving Dominican food and now is a Three Amigos serving Mexican dishes .
Frosting is WAY WAY too sweet and there is too much of it relative to the actual cupcake .
Horrible delivery experience . They told me 45 minutes and it took 2 hrs . After 3 calls I finally got my two cold paninis for $ 22 . 00 : (
Lines are super long ; only a couple cashiers open ; out of most items . Other than that , $ 1 breakfast is good .
Not sure what is especial about this place with so many positive remarks . I was there once and I found everything very mediocre and nothing crazy .
Took 10 minutes to have server first come to the table . 20 minutes to get the bill processed . No apology for the wait . Good drinks , poor service .
The brisket was overcooked and reheated . Not the best or even ok . Liked the live music . Wouldn ' t go again to eat !
This place not so good . . . they are mostly interested in selling new bikes - service not so much .
This is by far the slowest Starbucks drive thru . I only come here because it ' s the closest location to my home .
Menu looks great food made me VERY UNHAPPY had no flavor tasted like it had been microwaved Stay away
Tried the orange chicken but it needed more sauce . The rice was very dry . Not impressed with the food
I got hooked on the place for a minute then got a pizza that was cold as ice when delivered . Now I ' m done .
This place is so discussing I wouldn ' t eat here Indian restaurant usually takes 10 minute this one took 4 seconds to serve me the I said no I want my money back
The food is very bland . They do give you a big size portion . Mr . Wongs is the best in the area .
Servers seemed rushed and acted like you are taking too long . White rice , chips , meat . All extremely salty .
Me and my friend both got food poisoning after eating the buffet here in the hotel . They need better management to make sure that people work there are following the health guidelines .
Horrible service . . phone didn ' t even get fixed . . There goes 2 hours and 60 bucks that I ' ll never get back lol
Gel polish looks like crap and the lady doing my nails butchered my nail beds . Won ' t be returning .
If you are looking for a modern up - to - date hotel that is in good condition , this is not the place to stay , rooms are rundown service was below mediocre would not recommend to anybody
Worst noodles ever . I had the pad Thai and it was more like noodle soup and was way too sweet . I could not even finish it .
Cant believe horrible service and food awful nothing is fresh taste like garbage need better products the lettuce salad like 4 days old ne c er coming back
Is a long history dessert place , price is comparative however the taste is just average . I would still come back because is located close to me .
Service is awful . Waitress was so mean to us and we saw cook walking around wearing undervest , shorts , apron and flip flops . Shame on u guys ! I ' ll never come back .
You better Uber to watch a show here . Self parking is atrocious . It took an hour to get out of the parking garage last night for the Charlie Wilson concert . Never again .
Why does it take 10 minutes to get 1 combo meal ? This place needs an overhaul . There ' s no organization whatsoever .
Awful customer and hospitality service . . Observed arrogant response from the staff . . Would not recommend
I ordered the Kung pao chicken and it was super dry , not a little dry but extremely dry . I usually have good service here but the past couple visits have been bad .
Worst customer service I have ever experienced . Food cold . I would never go back ! ! Close this down . Employees unhappy and rude . Why stay open .
Great service , but lousy food . The food was greasy and certainly overpriced . But then again , what would one expect from a casino / bar ?
Service was amazing , the staff is great . However , I got terrible , terrible food poisoning from a salmon roll . Just a heads up to the management .
Ive been in here maybe 4 times and each time the customer service was awful . The staff is young , annoying and unprofessional . Totally irritated . Sandwich is aiiight !
gross but they have a lcbo and freshco one star each ! its a tear down !
Vegan and not healthy . Most of the food is fried , processed , and greasy .
Worst place ever . They did our departments uniforms until we finally started looking into their prices . They charged us 70 $ when Skaggs charged 30 $ . This guy is a rip off .
By far the worst bank ! Worst service with poorly mannered staff members . I don ' t recommend anyone coming to do any business here .
Customer service is non existent at this Whataburger . Corporate needs to send some secret shoppers to this location , especially the drive thru .
Awful . F this place . I work for Doordash and I came to pick up an order for a customer and the service here is f ' n ridiculous .
Lousy service . Post office only picks up 50 % of my pick up orders . The rest of the time , they don ' t come by .
Food suck , pancake very soft lot lot of oil service is friendly so 1 star for that .
The BBQ was not that great especially for the price . Overall in Charlotte / LKN area there aren ' t that many BBQ joints but some are definitely better than others . Try Midwood .
Lol these guys just weighed my box and said I couldn ' t have any more rice in my bowl , wtf ? Truly a new level in cheap fuckery
This place is gross . Everything that I got that was stir fried was old tasting . The oil had gone rancid or something , and everything I ate was dripping in oil . Wont be back .
This is by far the worse place ever ! ! ! ! I had reservations at 8 : 45 and waited 45 minuets and still didn ' t have a table ! ! Never again ! !
very bad services，extremely long wait，inefficient drivers and operators，highly suggest not to take it
This place was horrible , there were roaches in the cupboard , the lady at the front desk wouldn ' t bring extra towels , when trying to dial housekeeping it dialed another person staying at the hotel .
How can a place that just opened have a sanitation score of 93 ? Food was cold and the service is severely lacking !
Not sure how this place stays in business . 10min wait for someone to address me when I pulled up , car had spots all over it after wash . Go to cobblestone .
Wasn ' t impressed by it at all . Store bought pita and cheap ingredients .
I was overcharged on the already outrageous fees and spent hours on the phone talking to rude slow people to get no resolution . Horrible company
I ' m never eating here again . Tempura shrimp tasted like frozen shrimp and the cod tasted like its out of a box . Wasted $ 20 ! !
The worst for those that don ' t like smoke . The smoking area is dead center of patio . The venting made no difference couldn ' t escape the smoke . Awful experience : (
Went to truck at art in the park in Boulder City . Got lobster roll plenty of lobster and toast but not enough mayo ! ! ! ! And the order taker was rude ! ! ! !
The staff was not the friendliest and did not work with any sense of urgency or care for the customers .
Beef and broccoli rocks , teriaki chicken sucked . I have experienced better . ( insert farting noise here )
This is probably the worst sushi ever . Their sushi super dry they probably is a day old the beef salad is bitter and spicy the mango was not sweet their beef was bland .
Waited two hours with multiple phone calls . They were unable to tell me what happened to my order and issued a refund , but said they were too busy to send someone else out for the delivery .
Just mediocre . Food is ok but overpriced . Very limited beer list . Heist beer like their food is ok . Service is worse . Don ' t see a reason to return here
biscuits ? ? ? how is the name of your restaurant biscuits and you run out of biscuits ? ! horrible wait staff , was not warned of the biscuit outage till already sat down and ordered .
Not much of any particular thing . Big store but terrible selection for theme parties . Those items they do have seem over prices .
Not too expensive but not too good either . Only had their breakfast ( egg tacos ) . It was flavorless . I would skip this place .
YUM ! ! ! Excellent food , great service . I can ' t say enough about the Ramon bowls . The $ 14 " martinis " on the other hand . . . . .
The worst place . The worst staff . Stay somewhere else . 2am inconveniences . Credit card miscief . Do not trust
Cocktail waitress ? Here for wedding party and the group wanted to go here two nights in a row . It was impossible to receive service unless the guys went to the bar .
Kindly stay away from this place , my daughter is going her for last 4 years to the Orthodontist but not successful to get her treatment completed . The orthodontist keeps changing every time as they change places
Every time we go it gets worse . . . Barely any steak in my California Burrito along with a tiny amount of pico and soggy fries .
Rude unhelpful staff , I have nothing good to say for this location I never hard such terrible customer service !
The meal was disappointing and expensive . The best part was the phenomenal french fries . At least they have that going for them !
Drove by because it was close to home and open late according to Yelp but it seemed closed and there was no time for Sunday on the door Get an open / closed sign !
This place is disgusting . The food is not even fresh ! And everything is greasyI didn ' t think you could mess up breakfast , but this place does .
They were using profanity thru the drive thru speakers . No greeting sat in the drive thru for 20 plus minutes . The older lady on grave reminds me of a meth head
Food does not equate the price they are offering . If you do decide to order your food to go make sure you check your food for quality before leaving .
Waffles were very delicious and creative ! However very over priced for me and girla working the trucks in Gilbert are very snobby and impatient .
Even with the fancy airplane chair , this place lacked the friendliness that a children ' s barber shop should have . I won ' t be returning .
The worst chinese restaurant ever . Also unnecessary expensive . The noodle is tastless and dumplings are too thick and feels like frozen before . The service was ok .
Had breakfast VIB . Food okay but service slow , very slow . Only one waitress , no host .
Made the trip here on 12 / 29 / 12 and unfortunately this placed is closed down . Not a sign of life nor morsel of Indian food . Only a FOR LEASE sign in the window .
The worst bank ever Friday afternoon 17 people in Line with 1 teller 5 other employees joking around doing nothing Oh 2 greeters I would sooner be at dmv Suuuucks
Cowboy Ciao threatens us with a reservation cancelation fee which was never disclosed to us when making the reservation . Poor customer service and rude receptionists .
Get there well before 7PM or it ' s drive through only . So can ' t tell what the food is like due to not getting in and drive up could not work
I used to like to play here , but honestly it seems a little tight now : ( I ' ll come back if payouts are decent again .
This place is a joke , food and service is horrible . Nice location and view ( if you arnt seated with the sun in your eyes ) good luck gettin a hot meal here .
Horrible food ! How could a Chinese food restaurant in Las Vegas did so bad on its food . . .
Outside of car was cleaned . . inside of car was not Dog hair was not vacuumed . . interior was not wiped clean , was not happy .
I ' ve tried giving them a few chances every time I ' m just super disappointed . Bad pizza and bad customer service when I tried calling to complaint
Decent burger and wing joint . Most of the other menu items look like they ' ll be coming out of a box versus allowing chefs to use fresh and healthy ingredients . Decor needs a major overhaul .
I came here with family and we where all very disappointed ! The fried rice was mushy and didn ' t taste good at all the beef and broccoli was dry and tasted burned ! ! !
Very unlike chipotle & & unpleasant , did not taste nearly as fresh as chipotle & & the flavor was terrible I threw my whole entire bowl away . I will never consider going here again
Definitely not a cheap place ! Low value . Entertainment was not all that . . . Disappointing experience .
I was kept standing at the door waiting to be seated for 10 minuets . The service was fair had to ask for a refill . The food was very good
Ok place food was ok but overpriced . Turkey bacon was good hash browns not so much . Terrible coffee . Not pleased for what I paid . Won ' t be back
It ' s really a shame that local companies cannot support each other . This empty lot is locked away before the posted hours have even expired . Good luck , boner company .
My wife got a bannana mocha and she really didnt like it but she did finish it over the 5 hour drive home .
Beware ! Has a no gun sign in front . Business does not care about your personal safety .
China gormet on center rd . is better . The quality of food here is mediocre .
The cashier with his arms completely tattooed was extremely rude to our entire group . He even cussed at the customers behind us
The check in here is terrible . Realistically waited 30 min to check in . Only 1 counterdesk worker working .
Worst place ever ! Paid for manicure and pedicure . Lady only painted my nails and my toes . Nothing else . 60 . 00 for crap ! African American lady .
Taco salad . . . on le iceberg letters three pieces of chicken for $ 6 . 95 ? We are not coming back to this restaurant .
Customer service was great and food was good . Avoid the bathrooms ! ! ! ! ! ! There was feces smeared on the walls . The bathrooms were not clean in any way whatsoever .
SUPER SHADY Tried to get our group to pay before mentioning to us they were closed that specific day . . . Thanks for wasting our time . DON ' T BOTHER !
The place is awful . The service is incredibly slow . It took over an hour to get appetizers . It was ridiculous . I don ' t recommend . . .
Very disappointing . We made a reservation and arrived , only to find out that they would not honor their credit certificate . Ended up leaving without eating at the restaurant .
Very disappointing ! I think this restaurant is both over - rated and over - priced . Soup they serve is full of msg , not taste from natural ingredients . Not worth to visit again .
Not sure what qualifies them as a " craft pub " . This very small bar is a great place to spend big bucks on beer .
They said the store manager doesnt do refunds any more ? ? ? ? ? Ive never had to try to buy an item the same as the item im returning
Prices are good , but the stuff is pretty ordinary . Cinnamon rolls are below average , donuts are average , scones are a little sweet for my taste . The buns and rolls are good though .
Do not eats here the food is old and hard to the chew . Way to over price . Save your money and go to a real Chinese food restaurant .
The staff is really nice , but the food took FOREVER . They should think about hiring a whole new kitchen staff
My fish was really soggy and the fries were Luke warm . The owner was really rude to the staff and to me . I will never go there again .
I ordered the bbq pork , pho - tine and Korean fries . Pho - Tine wasn ' t good . Korean fries deserves 1 star , BBQ pork was completely tasteless ! ! !
Great pastries but the customer service from the moody wife is terrible . . .
First time here found a toothpick in my noodles bout a hour ago . Glad I didn ' t choke on it or I wasn ' t a kid eating it . Smh
Lady at the cash was really nice but the mac and cheese I got was half cold half boiling hot also probably the worst Mac and cheese I ' ve ever had .
Food was trashhhhhhhh . com the food is honestly not good at all . Really don ' t know how they have the rating they have .
Gas is more expensive than anywhere else plus extra 10 cents if paying with credit card .
Waited at the counter for 15 minutes for someone to take my order and ended up just walking out . Very unorganized and a very bad example of customer service . Definitely will not be back to this location
The man who made my sandwich was extremely rude . I felt very uncomfortable because of his demeanor . Won ' t ever go back to this potbelly location .
The prices are high for a common convenience store . The clerks were inattentive . Advertised prices were lower than actual prices and not honored .
The calamari had no flavor at all . The veal oso buco also had no flavor . The veal meatloaf was alright the fresh pasta and garlic bread were good . But overall a waste of money .
use to be a max and erma ' s and if that bar wasn ' t low enough it now misses the mark
The hair cut is good , the gal that cut my hair had zero personality . Overall the shop was dirty and I would not probably go back !
We stopped by for a quick lunch . Poor service , blow average food . Only cool thing is the interior .
This is the worse Starbucks ever ! ! Drinks taste like crap and you wait in line for 20min every time . Customer service , you can forget about it .
Dive bars are dive bars , but this isn ' t a good one in my opinion . Food was lackluster and environment just was to dark for my tastes . Bad memories , would not visit again .
Booked this side for more money because it hands sauna and pool only to find out it closes At 5 Save your money and book casino side for cheaper
Are homeless people really sitting in here sleeping all day ? What the fuck is this shit .
well , for that price I can do my own eggs , bigger , faster and warmer when served on my plate . . . waiters / waitress are not trying to be more than cold / medium .
The place is really cool , the food is mediocre and really expensive . Service is good , everyone is very nice and you will have a good time .
There was extensive water damage to our ceiling . Room was clean , bed was comfortable , but the am front desk guy clearly doesn ' t have customer service skills . Wouldn ' t stay here again .
I think they clean with dirty towels , this place is filthy not a clean spot in eye sight ! Looking into the kitchen where my food being made , and it ' s no better .
Don ' t waste your hard earned money . The food is horrible . Once the novelty wears off this place will go belly up !
This is a place I will not go to again . Had very poor service . And staff very unwilling to help . This place made me pay for something I didn ' t order .
This place is sucks for timing or they are racially profiling white people with tattoos .
Food is bad , and their in house beer is mediocre . Go for the atmosphere , not for what they serve .
Asked for a side of sriracha and got this so wrong just laziness so sad smh could have gave my the plastic little cups but noo lazy
We were later messaged by the staff to the waiters name ; and provided an actual name and receipt , but there was no followup post . The last review remains .
Super gross ! My veggie burger was frozen and my fries were probably from the day before . Don ' t waste your money here !
Delicious , overpriced and service was not very good . The employees seemed like they would rather be doing anything but filling our order .
The food was ok - The manager / owner was in for a few minutes and his interactions with his staff were excellent ! The pop machine was down and zero refund on drinks -
Service is atrocious . . . 3rd time was the charm . Never again . . . the ginger guy is cute but get your staff together
Bowling was a bit pricey . Pizza dough was a lil undercooked . Not sure if we would return .
Small portions , high price , low flavor . . . . If you dont know how to cook asian dont . . . Better off for the ramen at saka - ba !
Worse place I have ever been to . Horrible frail , old , dry food . Rude staff , dirty , smelly . I am not sure why this place is not shutdown .
The delivery is on time the food is good BUT almost finish the drink then come out a piece of green vegetable so disgusting！Don ' t know how they make that happen . . . . .
Can you do negative 5 stars don ' t give these people your business eat a hot dog better safer and way way more bang for your buck
Terrible service and dirty restaurant . The vacuum right beside your table . I ' ll never go back .
Party of 5 for take out , 100 bucks . - No Thank you . Never again . Burgers were not cooked all the way and dripping out blood . 5 $ ' s for fries - REALLY !
The owner is very aggressive and mean with his employees , not going to eat at this place anymore !
Terrible service in the drive thru . Waited 15 minutes for a family meal , and they failed to include salsas requested or tortillas . Food not worth the wait .
I made a reservation online for 10AM . I got to the desk at 10 : 20AM and was told my car was being cleaned . I had to wait 60 minutes .
The menu is a spin on classic dishes but it misses the mark . My friend and I had omelettes that were bland . I will not return because the food is sub par .
WTF . When will we get another grocery store downtown ! The staff suck the service sucks the selection sucks the no one seems to care that there are long lines every night .
Wow , the service here couldn ' t be any slower or shittier . 45 minutes for salad and breadsticks and 15 just to get a glass of water ? ?
Just too pricey . Nothing over the top to justify paying a la carte . Won ' t go back I have bills to pay .
Both my boyfriend and I caught a nail fungus at this place after getting a pedicure here . I haven ' t been back and don ' t recommend them at all .
just rent a car from Advantage and they charged me an additional $ 180 in fees for 3 days ,
Pretty good food , decent value . Drinks are not always stocked , they don ' t have corn tortillas half the time I come there and there were bugs in the lettuce last time I was there .
Maybe it ' s me but the tacos here are way over priced , maybe it ' s the downtown real estate payments but , they aren ' t worth what I paid for them .
Check your food before you leave ! They gave me three supremes instead of four and the wait was extremely long . I ' m disappointed .
I want to know why you can NEVER get my Postmates order correct . Why is the food never consistent ? I again cannot eat my food . A huge waste of money .
It called DMV for a reason I guess super unprofessional clerks as usual and line is literally always out the door and down to the other end of the building .
If I only had one day to live , I ' d spend it here . Time rewinds here . Suck it Einstein .
Absolutely terrible place . Placed an order over the website and waited for an hour and a half only to be told that they hadn ' t checked their website . Really rude and unapologetic . Stay away !
Worst customer service ever . Every I have been there the counter people were surly and acted like they couldn ' t be bothered . Never going back .
Greasy fish . It ' s A dive fast food restrant . This place is what gives fast food A bad name . The staff not nice . Dirty restrant .
Not great . 1st time was amazing . Short staffed , food was average and overall very disappointed . Wouldn ' t come back .
Nail technician texted FaceTimed and called while doing my nails . Took 1 . 5 hours Talked to her husband in bed . On her phone C
No attention to detail , I had to finish my boys haircuts myself when we got home the barber did not do a good job at all .
Nice and clean but grossly overpriced compared to Walgreens or rite aid . Bathrooms locked which sucks when you have a 3 hour drive ahead of you . Not worth the stop .
Just bought a sugar twist and a raspberry donut and both of them were disgustingly stale - no idea how old they were . How can anyone sell such poor quality ? !
Food was not fresh . Ate here with several people and we were stuck with stomach ache for the rest of the evening . Oh , and why is it always so freezing cold here ? !
25 minutes to get a basic car wash which includes vacuuming and wash and dry - wonder what an " express " oil change would take !
This location does not deserve the Hung Fook Tong name . The sago was overcooked , mango too ripe , black sesame was not hot enough and tofu pudding was not fresh . Do not recommend .
We were looking forward to finally trying Rita ' s but this unfortunate omnishambles of a place that made us both sick and won ' t be open in a few months . Avoid this location .
If you enjoy dirty , broken equipment , unfriendly staff and working out amongst a decidedly " down - market " clientele , this is the gym for you .
Overpriced ! ! ! Bad service ! ! ! The MOST important thing is the food taste REALLY BAD ! ! !
Decent hotel , but be prepared to be accosted with time share sales . When I voiced my frustration I was told that I could have " walked away " . Never again .
Worst service , we had to give a tip for a glass of water with the purchase of 5 cigars .
beware ! ! ! ! dead fish in tank while eating here and got severe food poisoning that day ! do not eat here
Today was my 3rd visit to this location all 3 times the customer service was horrible !
The filet was delicious . The service just STUNK . That ' s really all I have to say .
Very hard to reach . Traffic along the way and Parking Not Available . Ended going to their other branch which although a little bit far where we came , parking is plentiful
Sub par food . Slow service
Canceled my delivery order after a 40 minute wait with no explanation . Not impressed .
Just left here and they ' re out of everything , how does Popeye ' s run out of chicken ? thats like Subway running out of bread . . . find another location besides this one .
Tried their deep fried tofu in red coconut curry and it did not taste that great . ! Heard their fried fish in green curry taste good . Too expensive I felt
There is a reason they are going out of business . Customer service sucks . the people were rude . dicks whipped your ass for a reason .
This place is awful the workers acted bothered that I would patronize their restaurant when it was empty at 6 : 00pm . The food was awful , your better off going across the street to chipotle .
Terrible ! Worst foot massage ever n I ' ve been to many . Total lack of effort . I almost wanted to quit halfway through . DO NOT WASTE Your time n money here ! ! !
Anyone that eats Little Caesars Pizza must have no taste buds . All Little Caesars location ' s pizzas taste terrible ! If you want your pizza on the cheap side , get Domino ' s .
Not a good experience . typical stereotyped used car sales people . Didn ' t even fill the gas tank to save a few bucks .
Icky , ordered chicken enchiladas which came with a mystery meat that may have been steak . . . Not sure was so unflavorful . . . and lukewarm : (
Can ' t get past this : CNF . How can one patronize this place knowing you ' re getting screwed by a fictitious tax ? ?
This place gouges big time they got 22lr for $ 55 a brick . Last time I will ever stop in this place . I will keep shopping at Walmart and Big 5 they are more reasonable .
Decor and food very boring . No ambience could have been any restaurant anywhere .
Omg we asked them to limit the msg in our order but it ended up to be loaded with msg . After eating the food my throat felt like it was goin to close up . So beware
Took my wife here , prices are higher than any other spot flavor selection was decent but the customer service wasn ' t that great , every question I had was answered with a fast smart reply
Such a sketch place . Great calamari . Under new management due to drugs . . .
Update - There is a " for lease " sign on the building . It ' s safe to say they closed .
Tried the fish tacos and they weren ' t really exciting . The place seems like a nice place to hang out and grab some drinks with friends but it ' s not worth a special trip .
dont waste your time or money on this place
The service at this establishment does not warrant me wasting any more time typing than this .
this place is like a lost mazed , even the employees don ' t know where they put their stuff . Target is much better place to shop
This Aldo location has the worst sales associate I think I have ever dealt with . If shopping here avoid the tall girl with long dark hair . HORRIBLE is an understatement !
Do not waste your time or your money ! You will only get excuse after excuse why your appt needs to be cancelled 5 minutes before your appt time , very disappointing ! And very unprofessional ! !
Service lent et médiocre , ambiance quelconque , mais surtout un des pires burrito que j ' ai mangé : beaucoup trop salé , j ' ai dû en jeter la moitié . Fuyez cette place .
i got the worst hair cut here ! ! ! ! ! they are a one trick pony
Me and the wife stayed a night , the room was nice and appeared to be clean , however my wife woke up with Three BED BUG BITES on her leg !
Unprofessional man answering the phone . If you are leaving too early in the morning don ' t expect them to have any " availability " . What a joke .
Went here last night for dinner . Service was less than par and food was just okay . Will be a while before I visit again .
We used to like this place for Sunday mornings in Montreal but it has gone down hill . California Benedict was so cold and soggy it was inedible and service was slow and rude . No more .
This is literally the third time ( possibly even fourth ) in a row my order has been made incorrectly . Does each person there make their own version of the veggie sandwich ?
Completely overpriced for overly salty food and slow service . You ' re better off with the other casual dining options at the Wynn / Encore such as Red 8 and Wazuzu .
My friend and I ate here . . . he got the wrong order and I had the beef and broccoli . Both were pretty rough .
NO RETURN CALL after two days . Emailed , called and texted and no response . I ' m going elsewhere . . .
I think the Royal Jasmine Thai restaurant up the street is much better . The food , service and ambiance is more authentic there .
Rude and grossly understaffed restaurant . Food is mediocre at best . The manager is clueless to what his staff is doing . With all the options uptown pick somewhere else to dine .
There just wasn ' t a lot of flavor to these . We were so bummed as they were part of my mothers day present .
This is the first gym I ' ve been to that doesn ' t provide squat belts . I have asked numerous times and it seems like no one will order this basic piece of equipment .
Decided to try this since it wasn ' t too far away for us . The service was a disappointment and the food was worst . Not planning on ever returning . Sticking with The Good Egg .
Terrible service they should stick to selling boats they are clueless about customer service . Need new management great place for a drink that ' s about it food is not good !
Lobster and steak were both cold and manager said dessert on him don ' t believe this was worth food being cold
Cold burger after 15 min wait . Stale smash fries without flavors . Nice place without substance . Think I ' ll return to Five Guys
Clean room and good front staff service . . . horrible . . . . HORRIBLE . . . HORRIBLE breakfast ! !
Not good . Chefs not wearing hairnets nor gloves . Rice overdone , ginger in sushi rolls ? Wtf ? Would not go back again !
Fiancé ( and me ) kicked out of the show for phone usage " ops " . Negative stars if possible . Avoid at all costs .
I heard a lot of great things about this place BUT it just didn ' t do it for me . The food tasted OK but didn ' t have much flavor . I was pretty disappointed .
The food taste like it had been sitting out under the heat lamb or hot water ! Rice crispy too spicy including the chowmiem ! ! Never had such a horrible food experience at Panda ! !
Changed owners . Found the food not that great and had to listen to owners / workers way to loud chinese show on their ipad while I ate . Won ' t go back .
Below average food and service for the lunch buffet we tried . I was hoping it would be good so i could enjoy some indian food closer to home but it wasn ' t good unfortunately .
My girlfriend and I loved this place until the last few times when we ' ve ordered the cauliflower and chickpea wraps there is barely any chickpeas let alone cauliflower inside .
GARBAGE ! But hey , the portions of it are huge ! ! ! Sorry , I can ' t testify to any dishes here .
Horrible horrible service ! ! ! Wasn ' t even that busy and yet took forever for food , order was wrong , and waitress barely came around
We fly out of here a lot , horrible , they say it ' s due to construction . But it ' s still the same after 20 years ! !
I had to wait awhile for my food even though there wasn ' t anybody in line . The food was mediocre at best . However , a plus is that they do offer takeout .
Not good ! I think the owners of red and moxie missed big time here . The worlds worst sushi . Red and moxie are both very good .
2 Stars for the variety and spread . No stars for the food & freshness , pretty certain it gave me food poisoning .
I refuse to come to this location now . Staff is always rude and stuck up , plus they put a lot less fruit and granola in my acai bowls than the centennial location .
I have been to this place a couple of times and I left with nothing but disappointment each and every time . Their food is just bland , unseasoned and always comes out cold .
I was sub leasing from a tenant and was not on the official lease . That is why you could not find me in your records . I do have the correct property .
We arrived , were given water and waited 20 minutes before we gave up and left . Will not be returning here . Unfortunate .
Not impressed ! Service very slow . Food over cooked . Glad we tried it but won ' t be back .
The beer list is not very exciting and I really enjoyed the chicken jalapeño wings . By far the best I have ever had .
Not friendly and very slow , called for cab and said it be 10 - 45 minutes , not not good service . . . I would rather walk somewhere than take this cab company again
Very unorganized office . The whole environment feels uncomfortable and the seems like all they care about is getting their paycheck . I ended up having better care at the urgent care down the street
Checked out this place a bunch of times during Ramadan , but they seemed closed . Are they still in business ?
If you like to club with 16 year olds this is the place !
Not sure what ' s going on . We called twice with no return phone call . In the past we had great service .
Overpriced , way under seasoned ( the mussels and garlic mashed had no salt or unique flavor whatsoever ) and the service was incredibly slow . For a $ 120 meal for two I expected a lot more
Their food ok but not that great . So overrated . I had way better shawarma at different restaurants than here .
Basically another Filaberto ' s type with lower quality foods , smaller portions & a lot higher prices
I only come here to support the local Seminole Club . Great bar for beer selection but low quality food . Servers are very friendly .
Veggie tacos consist of lettuce , tomato , and sour cream . Veggie tacos are also knows as fries apparently . Skip if possible .
Expensive food , small portions , bland taste . I was not impressed and do not recommend this place .
GAMES DON ' T WORK should be the name of the place . They ' re almost all broken ! ! Food was alright which is why I have them a couple of stars .
this was not a company store - a true nightmare - approx $ 500 later . . . at least i am done with them - gilbert and warner
Over - priced , mediocre drinks and food . The portion sizes we ' re small and the meat to vegetable ratio was off . The ambiance was cool but I probably wouldn ' t come back .
Employees did not get order correct . Once I got the right food the buns were soggy , next to no chili on the chili burger , and the meat was full of gresel . Very expensive .
Worst sprint store ever ! Nobody here knows what they are doing . You are better off going to Sprint store in Tempe marketplace . Waste of time . 5 visits to transfer an account ? ? ?
They have really bad service . The cashier with the uneven eyeliner was super rude . 0 / 10 would recommend .
This place has one problem the staff and the management , the pizza guy knows the pizza was not okay but he don ' t care , he ' s busy talking with his friend thank you .
They changed owners , do not come food Different . Placed order to go and was not informed . They had no necessary ingredients . Horrible , won ' t be coming back .
When they say 15 minutes times that by three . dreadful . . horrible service . . take the cab
Very disappointed food was average at best , drinks were super expensive and service was non existent . They must not get a lot of repeat visits , just first time visitors , fool me once .
This place gets a bad review primarily because of the bad service in the pharmacy . They seem to be extraordinarily slow and not very friendly . Nuff said !
Good service . Food came out quickly . Average food taste . Nice atmosphere . Doesn ' t take American Express ? ! !
Food was good Service not bad We were sitting outside and I wasn ' t sure if I can manage to finish my meal because of flies and roaches
I felt staff was ignoring me when I tried to get their attention . Lady at food court wasn ' t very helpful when I asked about the menu & combos .
If you want to come over and see abunch of crabs and Worms . This is the best place to eat
Even worse than before . Prices have gone up . Service is terrible . Smells strange like mold when you walk in . Unfriendly staff . Food wasn ' t that great either .
10 + mins for a double cheese burger and after all that ice cold fries . No dipping sauces for the nuggets . The only thing fast moving was the napkin dispenser The struggle was real today there
Made reservations a month ago . . . arrived and try said their out of cars ! ? Guess reservations don ' t mean shit anymore . . . This some bullshit
Food is Nothing to write home about . I ' ve been twice for a business dinner ; service has been below average at best .
I take that back , the past two times I ' ve purchased ice cream products from here they have been aweful . There has to be something wrong with their freezers .
This place sucks ! ! ! ! The service is so slow . You have to wait a good 20 - 30 for your food . Do not eat here . ! ! !
Over - priced and nothing really stands out about any of the food . The hot wings were just store bought hot sauce .
Make sure you check your bag for all your items . Hard to eat a salad with no dressing .
Bad service , fatty and unflavored meat ! Never go back ! I hate leaving bad reviews but this was the worst korean bbq I ' ve ever had !
They charged tips even you have to take all the food by yourself , what a joke ! Also the staffs wear the cold faces！So bad experience !
I may have gotten the wrong thing here , but the peameal griddled crumpet I got was upsetting . It was too sweet and runny . Ruined a perfectly good Sunday morning : (
Yuk ! Miricle Mile deli closed which forced to Jasons . Not at all impressed . . . Some people LOVE this place but personally they cant touch Miracle Mile Deli . . .

Not a good beer selection . The food was also not great . The waitress delivered us the wrong beer and didn ' t know the beers on the menu . I won ' t go again .
it is a gross place that smelled horribly . Not sure if it was a problem with the pipes or anything , but it smelled like feces . Not going back there ever again .
Food is good but service is horrible Called in our order still waited 35 mins . My entire lunch break was wasted waiting . All of the dine in orders that came in after us were served first .

Food was mediocre and service was terrible . The server didn ' t say anything and filled up our drinks once . The clerk was down right rude . Also the naan was very firm .
There was a long line , so I was anticipating a good dog . What I got was a mediocre dog , very greasy onion rings that were nearly tasteless . Not worth the cost or time .
Depends : not my cup of tea . WAY TOO FOO FOO pour moi !
The food was okay . The metal shard that I found in my takeout noodles ruined any good benefits though . Especially since I emailed them to let them know , and didn ' t hear anything back .
Conference room is small Ice machine requires room key Breakfast is oaky Not the best location Staff is okay
Not authentic ramen . Nice staff . Food pretty good but will not return - there are better options close by .
Drove the Hertz rental on the Ohio Turnpike at 70 + MPH when I noticed the hood bopping up and down . It wasn ' t fully shut . Wheh ! That could ' ve turned really ugly .

I am not fond of diced vegetables . Asked her red sauce didn ' t get it . Plenty if cheese , tho .
Ordered this on ubereats . Not good at all . No tomato sauce on it at all . On top of that it had no flavour and they forgot a topping . Do not recommend , yuck .
Come on you guys ! ! ! Lets get it together , The consistency is getting treatable . Going to lose a good customer , plus the groups I bring in on Sundays
Friendly server , but service stopped by the end of the meal and quite possibly the worst fish and chips I ' ve ever had . And they were $ 15 . Terrible .
So I went there at 8pm today and it was closed . Not a very good 1st impression . I called before I came and there was no indication that restaurant was closed

Nah , all the positive reviews here are probably bogus . Just contacted them and they did not seem interested in me at all . Guess I didn ' t get to Michelle lmao ! ! !
It ' s just okay . Dont understand all the hype . It ' s better than taco bell cause they serve liquor . That ' s about it .
What a complete shithole ! Sorry . . . . but damn ! The food was nasty in the restaurant and not one person was winning anything . It also stunk like a huge butt inside !

Horrible service , food was tasteless and my husband ' s crepe was crunchy . Yuck ! ! Will not go back !
The music box sampler finally works ! I don ' t get why some of the music box in the display does not have a number on it . People at the store are very nice and friendly .
The greeter who check you in for the car wash was very rude , causing us to leave . You all should offer a class in customer service to them , because you will continue to lose customers .
The music was great ! The Teppan chef was pleasant ; however , the service was beyond bad . We waited over an hour and a half before we were served our food .
Texted , sent a picture . No response at all . Bum deal and bad way to manage a business .
NOT a good experience . . . . . I ' ll leave it at that . Something has changed since the triple D visit or Spike would have walked away shaking his head ?

Worst Taco Bell here could be - literally these guys speak no English in its correct form
Poor customer service . Ordered a watermelon smoothie but requested of I could change my order - they charged me for both since both drinks were made .
One slice of pizza was 6 bucks . There is not really a place to sit . The attendant wanted a tip for handing me a slice of pre - made pizza . . . seriously ? !
Can ' t believe how bad the service has been at this particular Sheraton ! ! ! Nickel and dining you for everything ! ! ! ! We ' ll never stay here again ! ! !
Not terrible , but definitely not great . The burgers are fried on a stovetop , not cooked on a grill . I used to go to Bareburgers but it closed .
Extremely overpriced limited menu and the wait for a table / food is not Worth the result . I wanted to like it as much as my wife , but i refuse to pay so much for atmosphere .
Low quality meat . It taste overcooked and unsalted . I ' m craving chipotle now
Its a cool place , just wish there was a older crowd . To many young people . Thats probably the only draw back i have .

Great service & nice place to hang out . Unfortunately , this has to be the worse milk tea I ' ve ever had .
Holy cow fix your parking structure it sounds like a dog whistle I have a headache from listening to it all day . I don ' t know why it does that but it ' s very annoying .
Worst newspaper in the United States . It is the National Enquirer for Fox news watchers

The first time I ate here I loved the mole . A few months later and everything had gone to pot . The food was mediocre and the margaritas terrible .
I ' ve lived here going on a year and a half and counting down the days when my lease is up . Artessa gives the image of luxury apartments when it is far from it .
I decided to try this place one more time . They messed up my order then rudely blamed it on us . The miso soup was terrible . I really miss the original owners . : - (
This taco bell always takes forever . Pulled in the drive thru with two cars ahead at 2 : 08 and i didnt get out until 2 : 26

A bit old and run down but if you ' re staying on the strip and you ' re tired of Vegas type activities the location of this theater is great .
You can get a better hot dog at the airport in Chicago for less . Sorry , but I think they are overpriced . Low quality dog and nearly worthless buns .
I ' ve been waiting for over three hrs now and to top it off I have 20 people ahead of me ! If you can avoid this UMC , DO SO ! !
I expected to get a burrito supreme when I ordered one . . instead I got a burrito supreme toquito . . .
Chopped salad is not chopped . Didn ' t love the salad . Cashier was super friendly and helpful .
One of the worst retail experiences I ' ve ever encountered . The employees are downright hostile . Why spend money to be treated like crap ? Never again
The incompetence at this pharmacy is fucking stunning . If you have the sad misfortune of using this place , at least avoid the man in the pharmacy . He has no clue what he ' s doing .
Horrible service . Disgusting food that ' s tasteless , processed and poorly made . Will not return and not worth trying out
WTF . When will we get another grocery store downtown ! The staff suck the service sucks the selection sucks the no one seems to care that there are long lines every night .

Over2 hours for an oil change ? With an appointment ? While I liked my sales manager on the purchase side , this is horrible !
Great beer at double to triple normal prices and revolting expensive food .
this subway has the worst night shift in anthem . they are extremely rude and absolutely hate their jobs . i will be calling the mgr in the morning to verbally complain as well .
When you enter the restaurant the cigarette smoke odor is overwhelming . The tables sticky . The restaurant needs a good cleaning . The wait staff is very professional . The food is ok .
Fast ?
Does not honor National Sub Day offer . They tell you JUST as you are about to pay . Too late to back out . WTF ?
VERY poor quality work , they had to redo FOUR TIMES because my ring around the collar shirts were never cleaned . I ' ll never ever return there . Total waste of time and money .
Shitty food long lines worst example of Mexican food I ' ve had in phx I ' ll never be back
Don ' t understand the hype around shake shack , it ' s overpriced burgers for decent quality . Nothing to rave about .
Price and Value are not matching ! For $ 6 . 50 I would say it ' s a ok , but the food isn ' t really good !
Encore un autre snack bar comme il y en des milliers au Québec . j ' ai pris un hamburger steak avec une portion très généreuse de fret mais un sauce insipide et sans personnalité .
Terrible service . Associates do not acknowledge people standing in line . They also do not pay attention to order details . Beware if you have any allergies .
I don ' t mind the long wait but they always make my Iced Caramel Macchiato too strong . . . I recommend going to the Starbucks on 99th and camelback .
Food was ok but really overpriced for lunch . $ 40 for fish and chips and a small starter - even those with a flush expense account might feel thats a bit much .
Great place but some of the barbers are rude . Its just a bunch of guys renting chairs . Some of them are a little thugish .
I brought my car here and supposedly my car had so many problems that a real mechanic ruled out , nice try Gordon but my car runs fine after a few second opinions
Very rude employees made unpleasant dining . Too long to get food served and water refill was never been easy . Also i got sick after eating here .
If you cancel the order , they will keep your deposit . Beware , they are crooks ! ! ! I wish someone would have warned me . Owner was blatantly dishonest .
I ordered a combination of boneless and bone in wings . When I got home I had a bag full of chicken nuggets ! I don ' t like to complain but my night was seriously ruined ! !
We had phone and make reservation when we came in they said we don ' t have your name we really disappoint the way they handle it seem like they don ' t care
A $ 59 tuneup gets them into your house for 2 - hours of slick marketing and way over - the - top up - selling .
If you like waiting then this is the company for you . The people are fine but forget about punctuality , it ' s not here . Take a cab and save some time .
No HEAT late Sunday ( January ) night and no one around to tell . 45 degrees for a 3 hour movie . Too many options to go back here ! Good Luck !
yuck ! if you love msg , go to fugu .
The store is ok . But one of the young blonde lady cashier has the biggest attitude ever , very rude !
Nothing better then having to deal with an unnecessarily rude and snarky teller after waiting in line for 15 minutes . .
Food was good . Service was terrible . Waited over 30 minutes for a water . Waitress also messed up our bill and was not attentive .
Over priced garbage . Got a chopped salad and the middle of it was rotten . $ 8 . 99 for bacon n eggs . Crap
starts and ends with terribly bad service ; food is mediocre at best and not served hot ; food tastes terrible and certainly not Indian in taste ; would never visit again .
called this guy , sent him photos of easy repair . he never called me back . guess he doesn ' t need the business .
salmon aburi is not good , was quite disappointed considering there was so much hype about the location up north . had higher expectations and would likely not return
We were at Hover Dam and stop here to eat . The beer was cold and the oriental chicken salad had lots of chicken but missing the basil and cilantro . Price was ok .
BoA usually have the worst service among any other banks around . But this one is way worsen than the worst .
Average food now more expensive and less than average taste . Avoid the $ 3 . 00 new horrible tasting healthy soda . One star for being able to sit outside .
This rating is only for the Karaoke room . Karaoke system is soo outdated , I don ' t know where to begin . Also , very limited of options to adjust the system .
Such a big restaurant however they pack you in like sardines no sense having any privacy for sure .
Not good . The crust was overdone and tasteless , it even curled up as you can see in the picture . I never went back . From Italy has much better pizza .
Poor customer service , they make passes promise and they don ' t keep , bad communication skills , and bad communication between assosiates
no ones home at 5am , wonder what ' s going on ? , waited and waited at the drive through , . . nothing ! , wake up people ! !
The pharmacist at this location is very rude and unprofessional ! While talking to her on the phone , she has no common courtesy and interrupts you while talking . No respect at all !
I thought this place had a great idea but the quality of the ramen was lousy . The tonkatsu broth did not have any pork flavor at all and noodles was so so . Hope they get better .
Probley one of the worst fish tacos I ' ve ever had fish was dry , this was a to go order no fork included window server barley Congenial
the property is undergoing construction . You may want to select another location until they are done . then you should let a few months pass and check the reviews again .
The waiter was not very helpful with service and he was very sly and devious about the bill and the extra tip he tag onto the bill .
They gave me the wrong phone and will admit fault . I just want my phone back . They told me that my phones motherboard coincidence when they changed the battery with non apple battery .

I wanted authentic Japanese steakhouse walked in and it was Mexican restaurant . Nothing is sacred .
The food was mediocre . The wait is a long time . I could have made a better breakfast . A complete waste of money ! ! ! !
This place is filthy and smells like a diaper . The rooms are disquieting . Do yourself a favor and find any other hotel . . . any other hotel .
Whack . Go to Marquee instead at the Cosmo . Music sucks , people are super ghetto . Did not feel like I was in Vegas at all : ( Waste of money .
Probably the worst place you could eat in Vegas . The only thing worse than the quality of the food here is the service . Please do yourself a favor and stay away .
Worst service ( by owner ) Used bare hand to handle food Scooped jelly that dropped from top of jar to side of jar with the bagel Disgusting disgusting disgusting !
Great view but awful service . The salad was stale and the food super blah . . With so many choices around they should take their food preparation seriously .
this ( dragon gem Chinese restaurant ) seems to be a duplicate listing for " dragon gem Chinese " minus the word " restaurant " .
This tims maybe gets your order right 60 % of the time . It astounds me the lack of attention put into getting the orders right . Decent parking lot and the employees are nice enough .
Horrible service on top them not getting my to - go orders correct ever . I mean ever . I will drive further to the one at westgate to be treated better
If you like your eggs to taste like cooking spray this is the place to be . Awful ! The best part of this place was the water .

Dark , dingy atmosphere . We ended up getting a beer and then going to a real / different Mexican restaurant .
Horrible drink . Ordered the moonshine huckleberry hooch but the bartender put in so much juice u couldn ' t taste anything else . She wanted to charge me 2 . 00 more to add alcohol .
Charging an dded 35 cents to use debit cards . They show no care about how you feel about it either .
Be careful ! Unethical billing even when you have NO contract they say you owe . I would like to know if there ' s a class action yet based on on the complaints re : billing I see
It ' s good ! It still needs work . Their spring rolls could be better , it ' s done amateurishly .
Great options and food but I need a side of pepto Bismo when I eat it . Not worth the dirreaha .
Never got checked on , they were out of ranch , no salad dressings at all , and they had no idea how to make a good mixed drink . What a waste .
Worst chipotle I ' ve ever been too . One of my favorite franchises , but this location is the stingiest and least fresh I ' ve ever been to in 3 different states .
The hours of operation is deceiving . The bar is open late but the restaurant closes early . Fell short of expectations after the long drive to check it out .
Really general delight ? You had some extra general chicken and some maybe ? Orange shrimp I don ' t even know what that was . . . . get it together .
Huevos Rancheros were cold and huevos con chorizo had a strange cinnamon taste . Very inexpensive but won ' t be coming back .
Fresh Kabob is not so fresh . The meat was dry and over cooked . Nice view of the airport , but would not eat here again .
Whatever you read in previous Reviews is true . Stay away from this place if you don ' t want to be treated like shit .
I killed 5 flies b4 even being served ! ! ! Management offered me a free desert ! ! ! Server Crystal was awesome ! ! Ya gotta do better ! ! !

Worst medical I ' ve ever had . My daughter had warned me but I thought I ' d give it a try . Mistake .
Cafeteria ambiance . Sarcastic server . Tiny , tasty , thin crust pizza , fire baked so hard it cracks . Would be more suitable as an appetizer .
Very rude and pushy waitresses ! I ' ve never been shoved by a staff member once let alone 3 times ! ! ! Never go back
So I just picked up my car . . . It sounds like there ' s a plane flying over me as I drive it . . . Great !
Great atmosphere , I ordered the Black Angus burger which was okay I would rather spend that $ 18 at McDonald ' s on a Big Mac though .
Rude clerks , not very knowledgeable would rather roll remnents and make the customer wait . Bad attitudes at the Niles store
Are you kidding , how can a Panera be out of all 3 side breads ? ? ! Someone isn ' t doing their job very well . First 1 star review I ' ve ever given .
The dinners was " okay " at best . Go just for the dessert - Banana Cream Pie . . . yummy !
$ 8 for mediocre burrito . $ 1 extra for good sauteed veggies . Carnitas were dry and flavorless . Flour shell made fresh was cool . Place is a blatant rip on Chipotle .
Amazing service . Very fast and friendly and even put my screen protector on for me . Very satisfied at the Time of service . But already had an issue with the screen not staying on properly twice .
Drive through window girl was incredibly rude on two separate occasions . Food was ok .
Not my favorite experience ever . They are open 24 hours a day 365 a year so that ' s helpful on major holidays but other than that I normally try to avoid this cvs .
Wow . . . went there once and never going back . Six bucks for what amounted to one scoop of mediocre icecream . . . what s waste of money .
NEVER go to this place . Trust me . I ' d rather use my Franklins as toilet paper than spending them at a restaurant which shuts the door to their awaiting customers .
Good wings , horrendous service . . . Make sure you don ' t go when it ' s busy . Servers can ' t keep up . .
Disappointed in the service ! No that great of a selection a lot of clothes were ripped and stained .
2 drinks took 20 minutes . But , while you ' re parched . . . there ' s comfy seats and plenty of entertainment to hold you over .
I dont recommend you to come here . . bad service food suck go to another place if you have a change
Pizza was ok but the bottom was really soggy ! Really liked the sauce though . I would give them another shot .
Disgusting and run down . Food on the floor and counters in the room . I walked out before I even saw the doctor . The receptionists weren ' t friendly at all .
Worst food we ever had in Vegas ! 32 bucks for disgusting eggs bendict and a couple of pancakes with sausage . Don ' t waste your money here .
Service was quick , but the gentleman was terribly chauvinistic , rude , and gave us a high price for something we got for $ 700 less elsewhere . Would NEVER go here again .
They sometimes get my orders wrong . I wanted a shine onetime and I didn ' t get any shine ! !
This is not the place to go for food . Everything on the menu is the same just wrapped up in a different package with no flavor or sauces . Nice patio for sippin watery margaritas .
Waited for 45 minutes at 7 : 00am from the airport to our hotel . Terrible ! No communication from the staff to update us either . Van smells like smoke !
Lots of ice and little coffee . Their prices keep going up but you get less and less coffee .
Terrible . shrimp small and not peeled or de headed . I came to eat not to catch and clean . Drinks are small and way over priced . Food did come out fast and restaurant looks nice
I only go to this Subway because it ' s close to home . But every time I go in there the staff is very un personable and rude ! Wish they would hire some new people
Poor service broke my dining room chair still waiting for the chair to be repaired , tried to scam 13 % tip beware of these guys .
Great Asian fusion food restaurant without the annoying Asian people .
I was very disappointed with the cake . It did not taste freshly made . They messed up on the flavours and the actual cake . I will never go back . I do not recommend this place !
The last 2 times we went to this location the dining area was very dirty . Food and napkins on the floors . Not a clean table in the place . We didn ' t bother to stay !
A fool and his money will soon departs . Save yourself $ 35 and a bogus $ 5 racing license and go get yourself a nice dinner instead .
Their salesperson is too pushy and followed up around . Carpet is too expensive compared to other places .
Horrible customer service . DO NOT COME HERE . It ' s unfortunate because Midas nationwide is pretty good , this happens to be the worst one i have ever experienced .
Crispy scallion chicken is not crispy at all . Rice was well cooked . Vegetable roll was delicious .
Horrible delivery experience . Very late , cold , greasy , Had to throw the zucchini away , it was so limp and cold . No responsiveness from staff when we called to complain .
Service was average . Ambience 4 star . Food over priced and just plain bland . Seems to be a happy hour bar , but Happy hour ends a 6 . From my experience , way over rated .
Service was great and effecient . Turkey sausage was over cooked and pancakes were average .
Waiting from last 10 mins . . . nobody even served a glass of water . . . trust me this place is not even crowded . . . yucks
There is a reason everyone else gave poor reviews Stay away from this place
Waiting 2 days for cough medicine . By the time it comes in , I will not need it any longer !
Came all the way here for the gelato this holiday weekend . Subpar gelato don ' t know why people gave abt it .
This place is an absolute joke ! They served me a beer but then carded me for my players card . The bartender had about 5 brain cells
Ugh . Completely NOT a good restaurant ! We had the prime rib and it was served cold . How disgusting ! Never will I visit this place again ! !
My daughter was very unhappy and frustrated with their tutoring technique . This place did not work her .
Less than mediocre brunch . . . . both the food and environment . The coffee was terrible too . Service was nice though .
Pizza was delivered in a timely fashion but it was burned and almost inedible . The cheese bread was even just average . I will not be ordering here again .
Really ? No carniceros , larguisima espera , las pocas carniceras todas estresadas y las vasculas todas sucias llenas de sangre y la manager bien gracias ! les dises algo y les vale !
Inventory in the computer is way off , customer service is sassy , and the wig looks awful
Their signature Bon Bon series is essentially a lot of whip cream , fruits and puree - like . All that for $ 15 . . . Disappointed . Never coming back .
Rudest staff in the city ( on multiple occasions ) . The only reason I keep going back is because it is close to work , and I need coffee .
A few items went missing after taking my car in for getting it shampood . They didn ' t get a simple pen stain out . Very half ass
Horrible pizza . The shop at that location looks out of place . Not recommended , even if you are on a budget .
Horrible hotel . Staff is incredibly rude , doesn ' t care and hotel is very run down . Would not even walk through at this point .
Ordered the mediterranean calzone , its too oily / greasy and the crust is soft . Nice service though .
Smaller portions and food is pretty bland . We got a calzone and chicken cheesesteak . Just not very tasty !
Went on a Groupon . Steak was ok but no big deal the wine was a 3 dollar bottle . No wonder why it was free .
