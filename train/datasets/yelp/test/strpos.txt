食材和味道还是不错的，但还是很 " 美式日料 " 的风格，不那么精致，而且每一块都比较大，很粗旷的感觉。不过这已经是土狼屯不错的日料选择啦。食材方面有本地的也有日本的，还是要问清楚再点，我懒得思考，点的都是 " 厨师推荐 " 。碰运气咯。 还是很推荐这家店，相对那些 " all you can eat " 要好很多很多，价格也没有评价中那么贵啦。

鹿頭logo的the alley中文叫斜角巷，店內裝修風格比較原木風，簡單又不失特別。店員好好禮貌之餘，仲好熱情介紹是日特色飲品。看了菜單唔知飲咩好，店員介紹的皇家9號奶茶真系幾唔錯，好香莓味的奶茶，好滑，推薦加珍珠。超好口感，煙韌又唔太甜，好好吃。分店有4間，下次去其他分店探店先

Fabulous Las Vegas ! この言葉が本当に似合います。 何から何まで本当に美しい宿泊施設です。 バレーパーキングではとても親切な対応をしていただきました。 ホテルのフロントでアサインされたのは38階のストリップビュー ジュニアスイート。 エレベーターを降りてすぐの場所から見えるのはマッカラン国際空港が望める素晴らしい景色。 部屋の窓はロールスクリーンが自動で開閉。 ロールスクリーンを上げるとパリスのエッフェル塔やベラージオの噴水などが見えて素晴らしかったです。 部屋のバスタブはジャグジー付き、洗面台は2つありました。 ジュニアスイートなのでフルキッチンではなくキチネット ( ミニキッチン ) でしたので 調理をすることや部屋で洗濯することはできませんでしたが 冷蔵庫と電子レンジ、食器洗浄器が完備されていてとても便利でした。 洗濯はカードキーアクセスにより宿泊者のみ使用可のビジネスセンターに併設のランドリールームを使えました。 フロント階にあるパブリックラウンジは広々としていて良かったです。 ラスベガスのホテルにあるプールは大抵が午後から日陰となってしまうのですが Elaraのプールは日没までずっと陽の光を浴びることができて気持ち良かったです。 ホテルスタッフはみんな親切でフレンドリーなのが素敵でした。 HGVCの施設のスタッフは他のホテルよりも一段とフレンドリーなので嬉しかったです。

雰囲気がとってもゴージャス。 以前ブランチに来た時は、混んでいてアウトサイドの席が空いていなかった。けど、今回早い時間に朝食に来てみたら、まだ賑わう前だったので、アウトサイドの席も選べました。 クロワッサンサンドイッチは、大っきくてサックサクのクロワッサンに半熟目玉焼きとハムの層、チーズがたっぷり。クロワッサン自体が軽いので、見た目ほどヘビーじゃない。 パンケーキは割と日本のホットケーキのように厚みがあって、塩気も少なめ。ジュワッとしたアメリカのパンケーキとは少し違う感じ。美味しいです！ コーヒーはポットに入ったままのものを継ぎ足すので、残念ながらそれほど . . . 。でもジュースはフレッシュなので、目覚ましにはこちらがおすすめ。 スタッフは気取らずにこやかで、感じがいい。 またwynnに泊まった時は必ず利用したい朝食スポットです。
