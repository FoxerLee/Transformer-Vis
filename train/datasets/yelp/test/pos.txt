Great burgers ! Expensive but probably worth it , and thats not something id normally say about a $ 15 burger with fries .
Great chips and salsa , delicious generous portions , and very nice staff .
Great location ! Nice patio ! Coffee excellent ! I love the salads ! Great service they bring your food & drinks to the table & they check back on you !
Can ' t go wrong with the Lunch Special . Chicken Noodles and Thai fried rice are favorites .
The Killer Tomato Sandwich is to die for ! Enough said . It ' s cream cheese heaven ( with tomatoes ) . The waiter was really nice too ! : ) I would definitely come back .
I got the turkey burger with avocado and onion rings . Not bad ! Hard to find a good turkey burger at a fast food place .
I have been buying this food since they open . They have a good menu and is very traditional Caribbean Food . They always treat you with respect .
i would ' ev gave this place a 5 but you have to pay for wi - fi ( as usual with any high class hotel )
The Salmon tempura was really good , the veggie sushi was a disappointment . The place itself is really nice . .
Best Ballgame Walk across The river is A fantastic Pittsburgh experience .
The food was really good , if you like Daphne ' s chain restaurants you ' ll love this even more .
Excellent service . . . very clean facility . Terri does an excellent job . . no need to drive far away to get your haircut if you live in the area .
Started going here recently and had a great experience every time . All the barbers do a fantastic job and advise you on the best cut .
Food is good , but overpriced for what you get . It ' s basically an outside cafeteria . . . which is okay if you ' re aren ' t paying top prices .
Really good taco spot but not quite 5 stars . Everything was good but not amazing . Loved the spicy cucumber margarita and the staff was great too .
Pho Tai Nam is my usual order . The broth is great . The food is amazing and the atmosphere is chill . Be sure to try the belly , crispy egg rolls , and the pepper wings !
Great place to visit before a show or just meet up with friends . Great service and very friendly staff . The food is fresh and very tastey . I look forward to visiting again .
Must try the egg drop soup with tofu , vegetables and citrus . Good food at a great price . The chicken and Broccoli is also very good .
Great food , good value , huge sides and it was really nice to be casual in a steak house . We will be there a lot .
Neat place . The burgers were great although very big . Fries were very good . Try them with the spicy aioli . Fried sour dough balls were yum . Good service .
Great place to get breakfast . I ' ve stopped in twice now & still great service . Tried the strawberry Belgian waffle & eggs benedict . Price is average ( $ 25 for the two items )
Hot dogs are so freaking delicious but not five stars cause the little cart by the casino sells them for 4 dollars instead smh
Love their meat platters . A better variety than other Italian restaurants I ' ve been to . Their pastas are also delicious and flavourful .
We love this place . The staff is usually very friendly and helpful and the sushi is always good . I recommend the " las vegas roll " ! ! !
Chicken pot pie was great . Service was a little slow but I ' d definitely go back !
Exceptional service and food , this is our favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto . It ' s a hidden gem
Charcuterie plate needs a bit more for the price and the old fashioned was a bit sweet for my liking . Otherwise the house made chorizo was good and the pork shoulder was cooked perfectly tender .
Line ups are expected but worth the wait . Food is always good - Always ! I have never had an experience of the Sashimi being off .
Black bean fritters rock and they have a couple good vegetarian options . They are always accommodating and make a good mojito . Oh and when they have the pumpkin bisque . . . oh lord !
Very interesting concept ! Pleasantly surprised . Friendly staff , nice atmosphere ! Its pretty cool Matthews is brining in cool , trendy spots like this .
位于kensington Market内，门面看落去好旧好普通甘，进店后发觉地方都几大，除了新鲜蔬菜水果外，还售卖芝士类、豆类果仁和其他副食产品，还有少许零食等。环境比较暗，摆设简单。但因为产品质素不错，还是有不少本地西人过来选购。
Very tasteful sushi and liked the two combination dishes . Ordered grilled teriyaki chicken and spicy tuna sushi . The highlight was the sake bomber ! !
Great pizza , solid price . The topping were great and fresh , the crust was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside . Definitely hit the spot !
Great food . Good beer and great service . Lamb tacos really good . Going back for dinner .
I like the Plaza . Good prices and nice location for Downtown . Right at the head of Fremont Street . The Subway and McDonald ' s are not very friendly and are overpriced however .
Really great fried chicken and cheap beer - would definitely come again ! The chicken was lightly battered , wasn ' t over seasoned and was very fresh ! The oyster Kimchi fried rice was also really good .
Excellent food and good value . Nice twist having the wine store inside the restaurant to allow the patron to select the wine .
Great selection for the price , very clean and love the sushi ! Go for lunch , only 10 bucks a head and still have maki and nigiri offerings .
We have always had good service but it cost me with insurance over 500 . 00 for one week . I checked on monthly rate , it was outrageous
Our favorite local pizza . Large portioned pizza . Excellent flavor to their dough and sauce . Also love their hoagies and calzones . Only complaint is that it is pricey !
My favorite time to eat here is when they have the all - you - can - eat snow crab . Never had a bad meal . Friendly staff .

Good food and great rates . The bartender is not the nicest but they have unlimited chips and a great happy hour .

Went here the other night for a " Girl ' s Night Out " . We saw " Marley and Me " here . This place is still pretty decent , if unspectacular .
Sometimes I feel like craving to fiveguys . Passion fruit with pearl topping is also amazing . Yummy !
The best dive bar ! Great specials , okay service . Have plenty of TVs including a projector but kinda small so everything is centralized . Easy to have a great nignt under $ 20
Great vibes , loved the spritzin water on the porch . Only stopped for a drink but enjoyed the park and atmosphere
Really amazing authentic food . Would have five stars but the place was very loud and there was some ordering confusion . All worked out in the end . Would absolutely go back .
Excellent fast service . . . needed the main sewer line cleaned out . . . Tom arrived on time as promised . . . thanks Tom will be using your company again
Finally had the food here given the great reviews . Had the jerk chicken and it was solid . Overall the hype here is well deserved . Around Cabbagetown , you won ' t go wrong here .
After posting my previous review the owner called me directly to apologize . He was very nice and offered to fix the issue .

This place is fairly small ( most people just order and go ) but the staff are friendly and their Thai Milk Tea Bobba is the best !
The BLTAE was amazing and super filling . The service was great and attentive . However , the mimosa ' s were practically orange juice , next time will settle with just juice .
some awesome margaritas were served up in addition to a really yummy lobster burrito . went here to get away from stuffy bellagio and got grwat food and service ! !
Great salads , beet and arugula salad are the best imo . The clam pizza is a little weird but the rest are winners .

Closed down in 2012 ! This was an amazing hole in the wall with the best veggie benedict I ' ve ever had . Sad to see the " One Man Show " disappear .
We definitely will be back when in Vegas . My hubby ordered coffee rubbed steak and it was delicious ! The toffee dessert was melt in your mouth yummy and the prices are really reasonable .

Went in with entertainment book $ 9 discount only received $ 2 off on two teriyaki dinners and two soft drinks . This place has poor customer service . Food was fairly good but chicken was dry .
Great addition to area - which is missing good breakfast options . The brie , turkey , fig , egg combination was yummy and the Pete ' s steak sandwich was definately worth a return trip . . .
Great intimate venue , staff is very helpful , drinks are surprisingly quick ! Only wish there was a smoking patio where you could bring a cocktail ! Always plenty of parking and a great local crowd .

I ' m not catholic and enjoyed the mass at the Sunday evening time . That counts for something !
creamed walnut fudge sundae . . . thats all i gotta say about that !

A Good Pizza Hut . Boneless wings were very good and saucy . Pan pizza was what you expect from Pizza Hut . Good location right by the highway .
The bar is now called Emerald . Great place for a drink in the Plateau . Good drinks at a good price . Atmosphere is very Cuban but Mile End style .

For buffet this was good ! We had sushi and Mexican on a Tuesday night . Not a big crowd and everything kept getting refilled as we ate . We would come again .
Nice place for brunch and breakfast . The decor feels nice and service was very friendly . I think the waffle there was the best I had tried so far .
Warm inviting atmosphere paired with a menu that is far from off the wall . . . but interesting and well - done ( except for the raw selections of course ! )

Great place for etheopian food . Got a managers combination and added one more item . Overall good food . Not a huge portion , but just enough to get full .
Food was hot beer was cold great place for locals but 26 TVs and only four channels represented let alone to many of them CNN . That many TVs should be diversified for all the crowd
Yum ! Ahi Poke Salad and Tuna Tataki Roll !
Very unique tapas type offering with what I call a gourmet Polynesian Asian fusion . Great great service and fantastic happy hour specials . Great sexy atmosphere with an after hours lounge and menu .
CLOSED . . . apparently another greedy landlord , too expensive to continue CLOSED . Closed .
Food and service are fantastic ! Everything is fresh , thoughtfully prepared , and delicious . Only complaint is the space : nice atmosphere , but they run out of room quickly ; feels a bit cramped .
Calamari was fantastically delicious ! ! Oven baked Pizza was great too ! ! Parking in the back of the restaurant very convenient !
If you don ' t mind a long wait , order The Cubain and pair it with their Elixir Iced Tea with a shot of bourbon . Excellent stuff .

High quality coffee tucked into a funky little corner of a comic shop . Look closely when on the sidewalk so you don ' t miss the narrow stairway entrance .
Noisy spot , good nightlife and great grub ! One suggestion , the foie gras . . . . not what it should be . But try it yourself and call me a liar if you must !
ordered 20 whole fried wings for my family and was pleasantly pleased with those crunchy pieces of pleasure . I will definitely be ordering again real soon . . . . . . like maybe tomorrow lol

You will not be disappointd . Deliscious entreys ! Great place fo take out or eat in . Heat up leftovers the next day . Yummy

Great tamales . Chicken mole is a must have .
Decent pastries and drinks . Whimsical old France atmosphere that is nearly too much . PS - They don ' t validate parking .
Out of the ordinary sandwiches . Large menu display on the door and above the register . Great sandwich , but a bit pricy for the amount of meat included .

Located past the security checkpoint and close to the departure gates , it ' s a nice place to sit down and have a meal or a few drinks while killing time to board your flight .
First time try out the Lobster pho noodle , whole lobster served , pretty good . Nice and friendly service . Try it out if in Vegas .
Stopped here at lunch time and the food was great along with our service . The waiter was helpful when it came to describing items from the menu and we received our food in a decent time frame .
Small coffee shop . Espresso and drip coffee . The drip coffee was very robust , like a moka pot was used . Pretty good .
Fun atmosphere and decent happy hour .
Had the sushi and sashimi samplers and it was delicious . The sashimi was thick and delicious while the tempura veggies were on point . Great food at a reasonable price .
睇完韓劇想起要食韓國炸雞都只係會諗起去呢一間，我諗冇乜邊間做得更「物有所值」喇。 佢哋新鮮炸起嘅雞，都係做得香脆多汁而可口。佢哋推薦係Original，但我覺得只喺落粉炸，味道比較單調，沒有太多層次。我反而比較喜歡味道層次感豐富一點的Soy Garlic。佢哋嘅炸粉薄而脆。儘管炸雞已塗滿soy garlic 汁，在上桌一段時間後都能維持脆口感。惟有美中不足的是假如有更多蒜蓉片就好了。 餐廳地方不大，最好就Peak hour前後嚟，假如坐唔到卡位嘅話，就只好坐喺比較狹窄嘅中間幾排嘅方桌位。酒吧形式，音響聲也比較大聲，佢哋嘅小吃都不過不失。假如同三五知己熱熱鬧鬧，這也是不錯的選擇。
Wonderful staff and great bar . Beer selection top shelf . Six for dinner could not have been nicer . Will definately return .
Super place en centre ville pour le lunch . Du choix et beaucoup de gout ! Bien que la line up soit de plus en plus loooong
Love their gold wings and Alfredo the dark ! The wait is always so long though ! I recommend going do lunch during the week to avoid waiting an hour !
Pretty good ! The chicken was lightly covered and crunchy yet lacked something . The mashed potatoes need salt but I need salt on everything . I would go back .

A great alternative to the same old same old . I ' m a fan of the design statement here .
Freshly made pretzels and hot dog / pretzels prepared right in front of you . Tastes fresh and hot like it should . Get some and eat while gambling or go to the food court .
The bar is great if you ' re in town alone for business . The salmon can ' t be beat . . . well worth the visit and look forward to a return trip !

The District is very nice , while it ' s limited on the what you can do it does offer a few nice restaurants and is adjacent to the GVR . The shopping is pretty limited .
Really great food and cocktails , just a bit overpriced . They have the best queso and chips and tuna lollipops . Staff is very friendly .

We got a asada burrito and lengua burrito they were very good and huge . Only downside was the salsa it was super watery . If they change that is would be our go to Mexican restaurant
Very tasty vegetarian buffet . The only complaint I have is that there were two TVs on the whole time plating two different news stations . Why ?

Excellent food , liked the atmosphere , parking a garage or Valet , entree was good , salad good , service good . Owner is new , and seems to have a grip on things .
The donuts are good better than Tim Hortons and not as oily as Krispy Kreme . Cake pieces are typically fresh .

My husband and I go here often . The service is good and the food is always cooked properly . It is never outstanding but you can always assure you will have a well cooked meal with flavor .
One of my favorite gelato places . It ' s ok the sweet side today . But service is nice and I enjoy coming here because you can choose as many flavors as you want .

Very good coffee , however service could be improved . Also , more attention to detail in making the coffee would be great .

Fabulous bread and decent amount of meat on BIG sub . My medium is basically two lunches . Tasty pasta salad and no problem with big order for entire office .

Pizza is damn good . Comparable to what I ' ve had in Italy . Only issue is it ' s overpriced and there are some real assholes on staff there .

Always great quality food whenever I visit . My recent visit was great because of the exceptional customer service by Jonny and Pia . It ' s refreshing when employees are energetic and passionate about their workplace .

Hi I was wondering if you taught a more advanced class of Bachata . . . ? For me and my wife

This is a nice little place at Brickyard which you should definitely try . They have a variety of options for vegetarians as well , wasn ' t disappointed with the taste either . A bit pricey though .
Canadian comfort food in Canada ' s most district department store has proven to be a home run . We have been lagging behind international retailers in the food service options and bannock fills the void .

Udon noodle soup is a very light choice but very good after a long road trip , they probably mistook the take out order for the other dish .

Can ' t believe this place is now closed . We dropped by to pick up some biryani on May 5th and were shocked to see the FOR SALE sign . Will surely miss this place .
We come here for our patties and sausage rolls . They ' re yummy and fresh . They also have cooked / hot food if you ' re hungry in the area .
Service was great . Taziki sauce was less creamy with more spices ( think dill ) . Not my favorite flavor but a healthier style of Greek food . Cute decor inside .
When I do take out , I always get ( it ' s a must ) : spicy squid , beef Ho fun , black bean beef , and crispy wontons . Never a disappointment , quite satisfying .

I Love In & Out . . . I Just Don ' t Like How Busy It Gets . . . Other Than That , It ' s The Best Burger Place

The food at Local is SUPER awesome , and was a very fun experience . Just be ready to battle the South Side crowd . . . : )

Quality of the food and service were excellent ! Price seemed a little high for the quantity and just know that the chicken tiki masala , although very delicious , did not come with rice .
Loooooove ! I had a delicious egg salad sandwich and latte . Loved the ambiance ! I was able to study and enjoy my food . I ' ll definitely come back again a and again !

Great music and fun vibe . Servers were nice and we received a table quickly . There was a imited drink menu but there are great drink specials .
Excellent food , one of the best Chinese places in Charlotte . Don ' t let the shopping plaza fool you into thinking it ' s a typical greasy spoon hole in the wall .

The food is great but a bit salty . Btw , i have had the drunken noodle .
I also look for a good independent coffee shop . This one was very good , wonderful soy cortado . Will definitely come back here when in the area !
I liked the setup and people are friendly . I wish they would have more seafood on stock but thats the price you pay for fresh ingredients .
Typical dinner place on the level of a good Applebees with great Margaritas .
I definitely like their sesame chicken over noodles . It is actually the ONLY thing I get so this review is solely based on one dish . Sorry ! Try the sesame chicken with noodles lol
Pleasantly surprised by this place ! The atmosphere could use a little work but man , are their falafels tasty !

This place is always busy because they have unbelievable food , fresh and reasonably priced , only sometimes you have to wait a bit .
Not the most glamorous seating area but Japanese curry is spot on and they bring it to where you sit . You can also puruse the connected grocery store while you wait .
Very good service . Fun , casual ambiance . Clean restaurant . All the food was flavorful , down to the rice and beans . They also have Mexican Coke . : )
Great place to see a concert ! Stave moves in the round ! Saw the Gypsy Kings there , it was amazing ! Easy parking and theatre access . I highly recommend this venue !
Broth was the bomb - beef tender and homemade noodles - thin or wide were perfect . Packed with Asian folks so you know you are in the right place .
Great food nice atmosphere ! A good chill place for my family to enjoy . Service was good and waitress was nice . I will definitely return in the future .
Fresh and tasty . It ' s a walk up and order place , they give you a number and you sit and wait for them to bring you your food .
Family of six . Enjoyed our meals . Great flavor . Very good service . We thought it was relatively inexpensive for the experience we enjoyed .
Although they didn ' t have what I was looking for , I love . 99 cent stores !
This place is refreshing , the biscotti and pistachio flavors were both great . Customer service could be improved , but there were so many people there .

Visited once on a Sunday night at 6pm . Dr . Michael Maiden is a great speaker . The sanctuary is nice .
Dry age New York strip is good , but not the best I have had . On the veggie side , their fig and apple salad is a must try . The kids loved their Mac and cheese .
Interesting menu and awesome vegan food . The power bowl and the burger was delicious .
Clean and relaxing service . The chairs are comfortable and the nail technicians are very precise on their pedicures and manicures . They did a great job and reasonably priced .

Bacon & Chocolate in a candy bar , thats all you had to say !
Yes ! If you ' re wondering about their fried chicken is GOOD ! Skin is perfectly seasoned as well as the meat which turned out so juicy ! Potato wedges were huge and seasoned too
Friendly , helpful staff ! The girl helped me find my book right away , offered me a bag , and didn ' t pressure me to buy extra items .
Sushi is great , nice people . The place needs improvement as far as cleanliness goes , the restroom ( at least men ' s ) needs repairs and remodeling , and needs to be checked more often .
Probably the best pizza in the Charlotte area . Does not offer slices so you have to buy the whole pie .
Yum . I do love this shop it ' s close to home very affordable and delicious . Great customer service as well ! ! ! ! ! Always friendly quick and helpful .
On Monday Banknote has 8 $ pasta night . The lasagna never disappoints and the servers are very friendly .

Amazing food . Love their spicy tan tan if you can handle spice . Great atmosphere , but they recently had a price hike so that ' s where the 1 star
If u don ' t mind the bums at every single station begging for change it is a very reliable clean system that gets u where u need to be ! !
Always reliable , always fresh ingredients , never have to wait longer than 15 minutes . What more can you ask for ? ?
Good food , nice atmosphere , friendly staff but loud and very crowded . Count on a 30 to 60 min wait for a table .
Great food , drinks and patios . The service is a little slow so plan on lazy unrushed brunch . It ' s worth it though .
First time here . The service was great ! Next time I ' m going to try the jerk chicken pizza

We went for breakfast , it was really good ! ! ! I had chilaquiles and my wife had a veggie omelet , it was great ! ! ! The waitress was awesome ! ! ! !
Basic Korean restaurant close to my house . Decor is simple , but food is tasty and affordable . Service adequate . Nothing fancy here , but good for a quick bite .
The wait to check in was reaaalllllly long and one of the managers was either partially deaf or very rude ignoring me . I just wanted to ask a question . Other then that it was fine
Love everything about Sushi On Bloor except for the long waits and line ups that extend outside the place on busy days . The service , price , and atmosphere are fairly good . The sushi ? SPECTACULAR .
Tried most of the menu . Good food overall except found the brisket a little too dry for my liking and think an au jus might help or something to give it a little more juice .
Loved my class with Eileen today . Great combo of cardio and core work . Nice homey atmosphere in the studio . Class mates were unpretentious and fun to work out with . Will go back !
Excellent dim sum with elegant decor . We loved everything . The rice rolls , shu mai and sticky buns were the biggest hits at our table . Great for larger groups .

Really good shrimp enchiladas . Good flavors , nice oration size , and really nice service . I will definitely head back there . I enjoyed it greatly .
Good local beer . . . Interesting food which definitely not what you would expect from a beer bar , but then again , it is Scottsdale . . . .
Great food , generous portion sizes , excellent service . . . All in the front of Caesars . Def try this place !
Mother of All that is great and good , this is the best place for sandwiches , they can do one thing to enhance their product though , and that ' s to toast the sandwich .
Not really into the healthy scene so much but was pleasantly surprised when i tried nami . My family got the chick - o - stick soynami and was delicious .

this review is late . i went for the first time and the lady who did my nails did a great job . her name was Bebe .

Mostly come here for the beer and sports . Fun place !
Good food , excellent desserts , 5 stars on desserts , friendly staff , nice ambiance and open 24 hrs .
Four star food at a three star price . If you are in Vegas , it ' s a must for brunch . Highlight : all things baked and the chicken and waffles .
Fast , good , reasonably priced . Been here several times . Be careful placing large orders because a couple of times they have been screwed up . But the food has still been really good .
This place is good but there is nothing special about it . I come here often for work lunches and the service is quick and prices are reasonable . I wish there were more vegetarian / vegan options .
The fact that this place does a vegetarian Wednesday every month makes them ok in my books ! The food never disappoints ! I also love sitting outside in the summer .
Cozy little independent bookstore in the hip 16th / Bethany Home area in the same plaza as Luci ' s Marketplace . Wide variety of interesting reading materials , old and new .
The food was good and you get a lot of food for a very reasonable price . Service was over the top as the staff was super friendly and inviting
Delicious with quite a wait . If you ' re interested in a calm and tasteful brunch this is the place . Just don ' t be in a rush .
This place is great ! Wednesday night flamingo and tap dancing performance . Food is delicious . Good spot for a date . The food is a bit pricy though . Over all a good stop !

Very enjoyable time getting few drinks and doing a little dancing . Live singers were great . Comfortable atmosphere and bull riding too . : )
Great beer , food and service . A bit pricey , but worth it . The french fries were amazing and in the top 5 best fries I ' ve ever had .

Really great fondue appetizer . Nice atmosphere . I like having a non chain , sit down casual restaurant in the ne valley
Probably my favorite place to enjoy steamed dumplings with friends ! Whenever I bring someone new here they ALWAYS want to come back !
Premièrement , le lobster roll est pas vilain ! Délicieux , le chowder est encore meilleur ! Succulent ! J aurais 5 étoiles si la bière avait été plus froide !

Besides what all reviews have said I gave this place the benefit of the doubt , only charge me $ 275 with my doc records . Super nice staff , fast , easy friendly and open minded .
I would have given them 5 starts if not for the coffee . The food is amazing and the ambient just fantastic . The fresh juice perfect . The coffee a total disappointment .
The food here was delicious but the service was terrible . It may have just been our waitress but it put a damper on our experience .
It was alright . It has a cool bar to charge your laptop . The gluten free carrot muffin is pretty good .

A good hole the wall bar to frequent with nice people and the food is decent . I would recommend the calzones to new people , pasta is good , pizza is alright . Drinks are reasonably priced .

A great find tucked away off chagrin blvd . food was very good , and not expensive at all .
Do you like bob Marley ? Fried food and cod in particular ? Then this place will not disappoint . This place really does not make you feel bad about those calories .

I truly loved this place is not huge but still has that New Orleans vibe plus the food is very good . I had the catfish with a side of fries and it was very tasty

The most authentic bbq you are going to get in pittsburgh . Very good food and huge portions . I just wish they had more locations .

We have been here twice . . . both times tasty food . . . kutchi dabeli is best to try if you wanna try this restaurant . . . . good service . . .
I recently tried Verrazano Pizza hoping that it would take me back to my hometown , Brooklyn N . Y . The pizza was very good - crisp crust , gooey cheese and foldable . Will be returning .
The sizes of the servings were excellent ! Meat was very well marinated and the grills are changed frequently to avoid the burnt BBQ accumulation . Price is very fair , however the service is relatively poor .
I enjoyed my meal , the ambiance , and most of all the music ! Try the oxtail fried rice with oxtail gravy , it was very good .
Great ambience , food very creative and delicious . Cocktails were a lot of fun . Great for couples and big groups . The grilled cheese with bacon dumplings in tomato soup were AWESOME .

Lovely lamb shank Great fish Excellent chaplee kabob Everything amazing
Delicious tomato soup ! Beautiful restaurant and decor . Situated between the Wynn and the Encore . Service is very slow
Food is really good and finally fits the price that is charged ( unlike too many pretentious and overpriced restaurants in Toronto ) . The mozzarella is made in - house and great to try .

While the portion size has gone down slightly , the quality of the food , beverages and services maintains its high quality . Mom & I made it our regular brunch spot .

Very good food and beer ( apparently - I don ' t drink beer ) . Not quite the same feel as SoCal , but I still really like the restaurant and bar .

Food took a while . However the staff is friendly and otherwise great service . The lamb Tegine was great .
love the gyro plate . Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection : )
Very good , I only had the Reuben twice and it was excellent , may be a bit over priced though and needs the kosher pickle .

Amazing bacon wrapped jalapeños ! Fajitas are the best I ' ve had and the house salsa rules ! Love me some Pink Taco !

第一次來的時候是星期天，教會聚會之後我們一大群人就來到這裡享用晚餐。可能到訪的時候已經為時已晚，我跟我的同伴點的生牛肉pho來到的時候湯底已經不是太熱了，當我嘗試吧生的芽菜放進湯裡它已經沒法變熟了，但是為了不浪費食物我只好把那些芽菜全部吃下。整體來講我覺得這餐廳的pho是不錯的，而且有三個size給我們選擇，但是我已經好多年沒吃過越南粉，所以不能說跟正統的越南粉有幾多成相似。非常好的一點就是湯底沒有味精，所以喝完湯底之後都不會覺得口渴。另一次來的時候是星期五，因為我來之前已經出過飯，所以我就點了一杯冰的普通奶茶。只能說那個奶茶超級淡，比我喝過的哪一個國家的還要淡，我已經是少冰了還是這麼淡，不敢想像如果是正常的話會有多淡。
Love the waffles . Great after dinner treat to share with friends .
Cool place . Very good ambiance for a date if you sit outside . Wine selection is good / fun , but not extraordinary . Food has always been pretty tasty .
They have a watch repair and battery replacement shop on the bottom floor . The sales person was quick and the price wasn ' t bad to replace a battery .
Been a few times and love the chicken souvlaki pitas . Good quality meat , good meat to sauce ratio , and great with hot sauce . Always friendly when I pick up takeout .
Great pizza . Highly recommend the Lachine and the Mexican . The wings though were terrible though .
Nice staff with comfortable amenities ! ! The pool is small , but the happy hour and breakfast make up for it ! !
Great wedding . Brittany and Brian were so cool . I loved the laughter and the spirituality . I thought Shenendoah did a good job with food and the setting was nice .
I ' ve had a brunch at this place and had some great . I enjoy some cold beverages , coffee , salat and a BIG muffin .
Amazing sushi ! Only complaint was on one visit they brought my miso soup out after my rolls . . . it ' s typically a starter , so I ' m thinking the waiter forgot about it .
Killer carne asada , good service , salsa bar , what else do you really need ? Let ' s be honest . . .
Got a mani / pedi . Man who did my pedi was super nice and did a great job . Rachel did my gel manicure . She did exactly what I asked for but was kind of rude .
Very satisfied with happy hour ! Food was delicious and drinks were well made . Restaurant and bar are very clean .
Yes love this place I w only take my dog n cat here friendly staff n great service

Great location with clean rooms . My go to property while in Vegas . The connected Mall has lots of food options !

Tried different sushi place in Mississauga and always came back to this one ; quality is good , service is usually good , but I am not hard to please .
Pretty good . Not as great as others , but at least I didn ' t destroy the toilet afterwards .
Owner was super friendly , and the decor was very nostalgic . The only downside is that the shop is on the small side and doesn ' t have a huge selection .
Food is good , but they seem a tad understaffed . The staff they did have was hustling and friendly , but way over worked .
Good hotdog , nice diner . Great onion rings !
They only recently opened up the Summerlin location . Great place for breakfast . There was really only i hop as a choice before . It is a welcome addition to Summerlin
The course is a bit shaggy this time of year but is an interesting layout . Great staff but they really need water jugs on the course as there are no fountains on the course .
Take a star for advertising free cookies , none left . . . Aside from that , the food was most excellent ! Everything was great . Kids happy .
Great food fast delivery ! Love the specials best beef and broccoli and orange chicken . The egg rolls need work but everything else is great

Got turned away from the Herb so we walked across the street . Got great service . Special brunch drinks and kids meals . Good food and service . More of a pub style sport bar .
LOVED the service here ! great place to meet for a date . very cozy patio and interior . this location is alot better than the chandler one . drinks are reasonably priced too .
The food was excellent , service a little slow to start , but they spaced out the courses perfectly . Fantastic wine - we will be back !
Outstanding breakfast . Quality food . Omelets are wonderful and potatoes are roasted fingerling . I have to go back for lunch and dinner .
Drinks were incredible ! Soft shell crab steamed bun amazing ! Bahn me was not great . Bread did not taste fresh and the carnitas weren ' t very good . Overall great experience !
Good burgers and good fries . Not a huge fan of the chili , but I come for the burgers and fries . Good friendly service too .
Damn decent drip coffee , 100 % would go back again for the brew . Service with a friendly smile . Great prices . Cool place .

All day happy hour on Sunday ! Great food great drinks and great music . The chicken Gyoza with the chipotle dip is tastey !

Just your basic GOOD Pho ! ! Quick . Friendly . Easy . Clean .

Good food , good service we ordered the Nahri it tasted great . Naan was hot and amazing . I recommend you go there and check it out . Best halal food on the strip .
Great as usual ! The only reason I can ' t give this location 5 stars is that they sometimes slack in keeping things stocked ( like guacamole ) . Otherwise perfect !
Finally , Phil worked with me days ago in getting me in and did not have to wait long and Min got me out . Nice service this time .
Great omelets . Huge serving sizes . A real classic . But bring cash ! No cards accepted .

I LOVE ! So funky , many funny posters . Food pretty good . Lots of posters . Cute boys ; ) Sangria in summer is yummy .

Meat loaf dinner very good , great fried shrimp , service good , outside seat in is nice but smoking , more crowded during snowbird season .

The Street tacos were amazing but the rice and beans left something to be desired . When I go back I ' d probably skip just get the tacos a la carte .
Mouth watering tacos . I had a margarita and it was fresh and delicious . The ambiance is awesome as well and the theme is consistent and fun .
Great pizza , delicious sandwiches , lovely decor , fast service , and the prices aren ' t outrageous for Vegas .

Good solid ramen on Queen West . Nothing to rave about , but nothing to complain about either . Would return if I was looking for good noodles and didn ' t want to travel to find them .
Beer has gotten much better . Citra quench is amazing . Wish it was available all the time . Hopefully they can keep it consistent !
This is such a great family restaurant . They are always super friendly with great food . The pho is yummy , grilled pork sandwich rocks and my favorites are the spring and summer rolls .

Good place to find organic producs , prices are a little high but I think it ' s good quality .
Like the area . Good beer list . Good food . Live music makes conversations impossible but that ' s to be expected somewhat . Their tomato soup is awesome ! The nachos are also above average .
I love this place . Granted , prices are a tad inflated it is pretty worth it . I meet my friends here after shopping about once a week before it gets crazy busy .
This place combines two of my favorite things : fries and ice cream . They do both very well . The pizza fries are , indeed , very good . It ' s a terrific guilty pleasure !
Water is top quality , worker is nice , place location use some upgrading it ' s kinda run down , ( but clean ) . I almost always go here to refill my 5 gallon jugs .
Plusieurs salles très grandes un atmosphère branché et des évènements intéressants . J ' ai bien aimé l ' endroit .
ベラージオなど、有名ホテルから歩いてすぐ、歩道橋の側にある小さなショップ街、 Grand Bazaar Mall内にあるショップです。 ジャーキーの専門店！ 店員さんは、フレンドリーで親切、三種類の商品をお試しさせてもらい、特徴などを説明してくれました。 ３つ以上で割引があったので、３つ購入。 試食にはなかった、スパイシーポークも選びましたが、こちらは味は好みでしたが、ちょっと脂が多過ぎました。 ビーフ二種は、間違いない美味しさでした！ 塩分も味付けも良かったです！今回の旅行で購入したジャーキーのなかで一番の美味しさでした！
So good and cheap hot dogs frys with cheese sausage . Deffently worth stop
Ordered delivery to the house . It was good pizza nice crust not too much sauce . Very tasty and had it to the house in about 30 minutes .

Best Indian in Madison . This is my happy place . The dining room is always filled with other happy Madisonians mowing on Indian . Maharaja - do it . And be sure to order the masala tea .

He breakfast hash is so good . Pair it with the chili mango sauce to give it some kick . Healthy ingredients make you happy to eat there .

One of the best pizza delivery restaurants in the Saint - Laurent area .
Loved this place . The avocado toast which I ' d read was wonderful did not disappoint . All in a friendly and comfortable atmosphere . Four sta8lty6s rather than 5 because menu is limited .
I was referred to this Dr ' s office by family . They do get busy but always cater to you . Dr . Hailstone is very informative and patient .

The food is same as Nando ' s in Toronto . The food is perfect but the only problem is that the place is very noisy .
I was having a sugar craving so I ran in to Super Chunk Sweets for their Blackout Cake and Peanut Butter Nanaimo treat . After polishing both off in a flash I was satiated . Mmmmm

Reliable ramen in Mississauga . Much better in Kenzo imo . That is all I need to say LOL .
This was previously a 5 n Diner . Much of the staff has been there for years . Friendly staff quick service . Food is good . Priced as expected . I like this place for breakfast .
This place is good just a little overpriced . The teas are pretty good , the raindrop cake is really to taste . I recommend trying this at least once , it might be your cup of tea .

Great beer store , impressive selection . Growlers and various taps for your pleasure . The staff is goofy and friendly . Make sure to ask about " Baltika "

The food was good but it took almost 45 mins to bring the food to us . The environment was nice and quiet .
This place is a winner . Pizza has elements of Monical ' s and Papa Del ' s . . . but brings it ' s own game to the table . Recommend !

Really good pizza & excellent garlic knots . However , if you are looking for any craft beers beyond Fat Tire , this isn ' t the place for you .
Not even remotely healthy , but that aside , I really like it here . Fast friendly service , interesting food , great treatment of tofu . Comfort food for sure .

说是法餐，一半快餐一半意餐。跑堂的貌似印度人，英语难懂。看套餐18挺好点了3个，又要了soup一个，跑堂的说套餐包括soft drink 有汤，把我绕糊涂了。后来他又来说搞错了，不多收钱了。鲑鱼还有奶酪夹面包都不错，汤也挺好。分量挺足，价格相对不算贵。
