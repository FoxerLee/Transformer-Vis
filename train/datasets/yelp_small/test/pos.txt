I ' ve been to Akahana a few times and I loved each time . You can ' t beat sushi and going next door to Rita ' s for frozen custard .

Healthy , fast and delicious . Would like to have some local crusty bread instead of pita offered . 21 different salad dressings made from scratch daily !
Excellent wine selection , food and service . I really enjoy the environment , very chic place . Reasonable prices . If you go , you have to try the spinach and Brie pizza .
Food was delicious , all enjoyed the night out . Our server was not all that personable and could have checked on us more frequently , hence the 4 stars vs 5 .
It was very good . I had the miso soup , field green salad and the ocean roll ; delish ! I will definitely be going back to try something else .
Can ' t go wrong world rounded as they have a Mexican restauran as well to suite your needs

This was my first time here and was impressed ! Excellent selection on the menu and the food was excellent ! ! Had the Orchard omelet , it was yummmmmmy ! Definitely will be back
We sat in the tree house ; very cool atmosphere although the mall brought it down a bit . Food was very good as was the service . A notch below the SW steakhouse .
Good place if you are craving yakitori . They have mostly chicken though . The grilled makeral is tasty . Large selection in general .
The best service , bartenders are the nicest women . Had a great meal at the bar . Amazing

Good food . Attentive and friendly server and super accommodating for the kids ! We find that the specials are sometimes smaller portions than expected but the regular menu is great .
It ' s good sandwiches but they won ' t change your life . I think its a Montreal institution and the garden is cute .
One cupcake was really good , the other was not . It ' s very hit or miss here . It ' s really the frosting that makes some cupcakes bad .
I do not frequent Ethiopian restaurants but when I come to Charlotte I always eat here .
Had brunch on Saturday . Was good overall . Might be a little pricey for the area but good food and nice atmosphere .
They have an okay service need more than one people working there . They take too long , but they are nice employees

Great atmostphere ! great bar food ! if you get the chicken wings ask for extra wing sauce .
Awesome place to stay if you have kids . We got the 3 bs penthouse and it was fabulous . Totally recommend this place . Pools are clean and in a great location .
Seems to be always understaffed and a long wait . Only one person serving food and a long line today made it even worse than before .
Great produce , decent prices . I love to support local when its worth it .
Thank you for offering a vegan item . I hope to see more vegan variety in the future from Joe ' s Farm Grill .
Engineering took care of broken A / C in record time without waking up kids at 11 : 30 pm . Clean Hotel / Casino , security checks pool area frequently too .

Very good pizza but also very expensive . Not sure this would be a regular pizza stop because of that . Friendly people .
Brought in a steel slightly bent wheel and they fixed it in 10 minutes . They are professional and I ' d recommend them for all your wheel and hub cap needs .
Update - I stopped in here again recently , it this location really seems to have turned around . Donuts were stocked , coffee was good , and staff seemed to have improved a lot .
Have been dropping in for lunch . Tuesday they have fish tacos that are really good . Nice n casual .

First time trying after yoga and have to say the gyro and the falafel were excellent and staff was very friendly ! Definitely will be back .
Out of 5 : 3 . 5 - Croissant : delicate and airy 3 . 5 - Almond Croissant : crunch almonds , not overpowering light filling
The hot rice bowl with bulgogi was delicious . There was a lot of meat and the rice and veggies had good flavor .
Very good food and I return all the time . I had the beef fried rice and it was great . I only wish they delivered instead of just carry out .
Huge portions and cheap prices . Cash only but an ATM is inside . . . really ? The one star ding is for not accepting digital transactions .
Really tasty steak tacos ! A bit on the pricey side for 2 . The steak is chopped into small pieces and you won ' t need a toothpick afterwards ( BONUS ) : )
Loe the local artists they have who have their work for sale . Nice place to pick up a gift for someone
Really great food ! Guilty pleasure of mine ! Really wish they had vegan waffles or vegan option though !

Best place for late night food ! Pizzas were really good , bruschetta was pretty good and the service was great ! Everyone who worked there was really friendly : )
I love their chicken and cheese . There ' s just plenty of heat in the sauce but not so much that it overpowers the other flavours . The spicy wings are equally delicious .
This was a great show . So much more than I expected . He is so multitalented and a great showman . I would definitely recommend this show . Bring your kids they will love it .
Yummy burgers with delicious gluten free bun ! You can also buy a pack of house made gluten free buns ! ! Cool !

The classic place to buy bagels in Montreal
Holy Cleveland , the antipasto salad is huge ! Pizza slices waiting for you . The pizza is delicious . Tower City location is great . I am a fan !

Very relaxing pedicure with a friendly technician . Loved the orange scrub , hot towels and especially the hot stones . Great selection of OPI & China Glaze polishes ( among others ) . Reasonably priced .
The acai is very good , but the service and system they have cause the wait time to be a little to long . Minor fixes & this place could definitely be a 5 star
Great bloody Mary ' s ! Very quaint and everyone was very friendly . Did not have anything to eat but the place was busy for a Friday afternoon so food must be decent .

Super agréable . Menu style tapas mais avec des mets japonais . Place parfaite pour être en amis . Faite des réservations la fds car c ' est plein .
Korean food here is better than most of what I ' ve had back in my country . But do not recommend BBQ . Noodles soup and rice is much better !

Cool looking store , I ' ve bought some boots / shoes here , Nice staff
I can ' t remember the last time I experienced great customer service at a fast food joint . Keep up the good work El Pollo Asst Manager !
Food was taste and cooked correctly . The only complaint would be that they were out of 2 items we ordered first . It is a bar and you are out of beer .
If you love Egg Benedicts this is the place to go . Very delicious breakfast . Very arty atmosphere . Excellent Bloody Mary ' s .
Our favorite place for the last 18 years . Always good always great quality . Can get very busy around noon . The best Dim Sum we have had anywhere . Hard to say anything else .

Awesome , authentic Mexican food . Huge portions , fresh toppings and a great atmosphere .

The italien cuisine provided by this restaurant is quite good . I went there because of an activity of school . I ordered a pasta with tomatoes , spinach and shrimps . It tasted good .

Great prime rib bruschetta is wonderful been here a few times last time Linda saved the day and replaced my fatty prime rib with one of the best I ' ve ever had
Great ice tea and dirty chai tea !
They do the General Tso ' s chicken without bell peppers , pineapple and other crap . This is known as the correct way ! Other Chinese places , be more like Asian Wok !

This place is good but for all you can eat , i would recommend dont go for the crabs . Its frozen and not worth $ 6 upgrade .
