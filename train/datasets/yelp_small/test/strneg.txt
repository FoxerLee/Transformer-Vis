okay ambience . worst sangria of my life . service is great . they have a really nice patio you have to check out !
We had to wait forever and the pizza wasn ' t good . I went with 5 other people and none of us liked our food .
This is not the best pho in the Valley . I hate to write a poor review of a business but don ' t get your hopes up if you ' re a pho enthusiast .
How you goin to get rid of the stuff quesadilla wtf get the fuck out of here that ' s the best fuckin thing on menu fuck
That was not a real latte . It was fade , full of foam like a cappuccino , it ' s like they didn ' t know the difference between both of them . i was quite disapointed .
This place is Understaffed . All the chairs were occupied in the waiting room . It took almost 2 hrs to get routine bloodwork done .
Service was so so bad . Only good thing was the brisket . $ 26 . 95 and didn ' t even come with ice cream . . .
今回の旅行で一番最悪なホテルでした。 まず、チェックイン時にチェックイン機を使って手続きをしていたのですが、カードが読み取れず何度もやり直しているのに、スタッフはじーっと横で見てるだけ、カードが通らないのだけど相談すると「反対なんじゃない？」と一言。嫌々、間違ってないし ( 念の為反対でもトライした ) また何度もやり直し、これは絶対おかしいと思いもう一度確認「日本のは使えない」ってまた一言。何それ？！ 結局無駄な時間を過ごしカウンターでのチェックインに、カウンターで自分達の順番になったと思ったら、スタッフが「今無理待って」と、パソコンみながら何やらイライラしながら作業し始め、結局数分待たされた挙句に別のスタッフに回され、やっとチェックイン そのスタッフは丁寧でしたが、なんとも嫌な気持ちで部屋に向かうことに 部屋は、2部屋中の1部屋が煙草の臭いが凄く、頭が痛くなるレベル 部屋が古いことはわかっていましたが、うん、本当古い。勿論テレビ以外何もありません ( わかってはいたけど ) もう、テンション下がりまくり、ここに2泊、間違った選択でした。 因みに、カウンター横の売店の水は高く、確か＄6位、それだけなら良いけど店員は横柄な態度で最悪。 良かったのは、立地‼ 本当これだけです！ もう絶対に泊まりません。 こんなにスタッフの教育がなっていないホテルは初めて、ある意味良い勉強になりました。
I waited quite a while for my food to come . And the food was below average . I could ' ve just go to Mcdonalds rather than spending $ 30 for nonexistent service and the long wait .
Food is 3 stars . But when i got the bill，the waiter compelled me to pay for 17 % tip . （The sevice is just 3 stats）It ' s awful！
Avoid this place . unorganized is an under statement made an appointment a week in advance after an hour still waiting to get in . Absolutely ridiculous , places like this should never be running behind .
I got some sushi from here and it was horrible ! ! It was filled with little fish bones throughout the entire two rolls I purchased ! ! Don ' t bother buying sushi from here ! !
When they get very busy they start getting sloppy and only seam to care for the ones that only have appointments .
Congratulations to the plaza for having the hardest most uncomfortable mattresses in all the land !
No soda water ? This place used to be great now they have lower end alcohol and mediocre drinks . Stop posing as Italian , be who you were born to be !
I think this place has closed . No cars there for the last few days and their phone number doesn ' t seem to work anymore .
I only ordered from here because my regular chinese delivery was closed . My fried rice was burnt and dry and hot and sour soup was cold . Won ' t order again .
Drive thru botched order by not including straws or dipping sauces . Does that warrant a one - star ? I dunno , it ' s just stoopid .
Was dirty . Many flies flying around our food . Salad bar was right in front of a window 90 + degree weather . Coleslaw was very warm . Restaurant is not for me .
Intentionally miss pick up and double charge . Worst company yet . Need to switch asap .
Well so everyone else knows , call before you go here because they sometimes they close their whole restaurant for private parties . Guess this is just a downside of being a popular place .
I stopped here today and sometimes you eat something and immediately regret it . . . . well that happened today there were hard things in it . . . gristle or something oh well live and learn
The hamburger was ok but not well seasoned . . . tasted bland even with the condiments . The fries were average . Way over priced though .
This people its very bad customer service in special the lady speak Spanish . . and the manager too .
Not good at all steak tacos burnt and even the kids did not like it ahi tuna is fishy
I can usually eat Wendy ' s , but this location ' s chicken sandwiches are very dry and the fries were cold . Wasn ' t to impressed . I won ' t be back .
Dined at the teppanyaki table , way over price for what you get . Service is bad , don ' t bother .
Good service . But this place is highly over rated and over priced .
Very disappointed . Servant doesn ' t speak English well and service is awful . Will not come again .
Chase credit cards no longer provides e - bills to other banks . This makes online bill pay a lot of work .
Boring place and bad service . The burgers come on regular bread . The fries suck , the menu is boring except the Lemon Creme Mussels . Not coming back anymore
Pop corn chicken was a fail . No basil leaves were added at all . Tastes like regular fried chicken .
Again they got our order wrong . If there is one thing that is guaranteed it is this place will get your order wrong 50 % of the time . lol watch out .
Why is this place so popular ? Bad coffee and below average food .
Picked up a beef fajita burrito at the drive thru . Long strips of " meat " that was mostly connective tissue and completely unchewable . I ' ve never had beef fajitas like this , very disappointed .
Hours are wrong on Yelp . Closes an hour earlier then it says . Lame to drive all the way there as Yelp says it ' s the only open taqueria to be turned away .
Disappointing . Drinks can taste the powder and waffles are way too thick . Not recommended .
I went with some friends for Peking duck . I would say the service wasn ' t very good . The staff wasn ' t the nicest and the food was very mediocre .
New location , bad chain like interior , really loud . Same average food and poor service attitude . Sad they lost all the character of the old place with only a new interior in exchange .
After 10 : 00 PM it turns to 21 + for seating anywhere in the restaurant . Steak and eggs no more . Adios Arizona Charlie ' s . . .
Read wonderful reviews on Yelp . Placed reservation on Open Table . Received confirmation . Arrived at restaurant on time . Restaurant closed ! ! ? ! Now sure why . . .
I ordered a # 2 pork roll sandwich . I nearly chipped / broke my tooth biting into it . Sandwich was hard as a rock . Very disappointing compared to California ' s lee sandwiches .
Ordered a pizza to a nearby hotel and they never delivered it and charged my card . . . Not sure what kind of scam they have going on . Beware of this place .
The funnel cake was great however the sullen teenage server provided terrible service !
Horrendous experience . Food was lousy . Service was worse . Everyone needs a good talking to .
Just had the General Tso right out of the kitchen . Did not taste good , over priced , short size on the portion . Egg roll was ok .
Was not opened when we got there . Claimed to open at 12 noon while they tried to get the air conditioning to work .
Horrible rooms . Front desk takes over an hour to get checked in . Not worth it with all the properties in Vegas .
Ordered the french toast and eggs . It was gross . The eggs were watery and there were barely any berries on the french toast . French toast was dry and bland . Will never come back again .
How do I give it less than 1 star . Menu is vague , and service was atrocious . Left after not getting water for 15 minutes . Yelp me out here and shut em down .
If you want inattentive service bland food under coined pasta over charging then please visit this Oregano ' s
Mal servicio supet caro y bien mal servido . Pedi una mulita me la dieron fria y mas bien parecia taco yni guacamole le pusieron . No vayan a comet alli .
Pho broth was bland . It was just eh . I have had better . Service was good though and people were nice .
Food good , prices ridiculous ! Burger w / sweet potato fries and 1 hi - ball drink were $ 32 before tip ! ! ! No burger is that good .
They have cut the chicken parm potion in half for the same price ! Chicken was also very rubbery tonight for the first time but they did the right thing and took it off the bill .
The worst slowest pharmacy . There be two people and they act like they are slammed busy moving with turtle speed .
I came to South Park Mall with my boy expecting a great time . They had a lot of nice stores to choose from but to my surprise , NO BITCHES . 2 thumbs down . Would NOT recommend
Food is ok not that great compared . . . but service is too bad . . you cant imagine how slow and how unresponsive it is . Even food is ok service is bad so 1 star
No bueno . Lousy service . Poor interpretation of " Mexican " food . My date got food poisoning . . . . enough said .
They don ' t do varicose veins , only spider veins . One leg costs $ 200 plus GST . They are not doctors .
Not first or second time more than four times I experienced bad service from drive thru ! They need to give proper training for the workers ! ! Zero tolerance customer service ! !
Food is very good ! Service is the worst of the worst ! Servers everywhere but no one to direct them to do their jobs . Servers do not smile . . .
Same starbucks as any other , but the prices are way higher . Ridiculous pricing , doesnt worth it .
food taste bad and unfresh , still charge $ 10 for the leftover . i will never go there again
* sighs * bad poke . This is the first . I am sure it ' s an isolated incident . Have been donating blood for 5 years and this is the first
I never post . But this place was well below expectations . Flat Beer . Cold Fries . Burger underwhelming . Only redeeming part was my great company . Don ' t go here
Went there for dinner with business associates . The food was terrible and the service was crap . If you need a restaurant in TI , go to Asle instead .
Was there yesterday buffet lunch . First impression was the food was the day before s . I was so right . The only fresh was the roti . I cannot see myself there again .
Hmmmm . . . . looking at my reviews I noticed this was all wrong so here ' s my update . I ' m so sorry if I misled any patrons that ended up not happy .
Ordered the vegan fish tacos , they were sloppily made and set me back $ 17 . Was really hoping to like this place but this was a bummer . Would not recommend .
One of the worst hotels my family and I have ever stayed in . Crusty sheets . Paper thin walls . Crappy pool . Monumental waste of money .
Absolutely rude service and only half the hotel is renovated ! Worst stay ever ! ! ! !
Got a burger with spring rolls for lunch on Monday , spent all Monday evening being sick and am still recovering from food poisoning . I am NOT a happy camper .
The staff here is extremely rude . They called one of their servers as being mentally ill and said she was homeless while she was cleaning up the tables .
The taste is not too bad but the amount of meat is so small eventhough high pruce and thickness of meat is so thin layered . I will not go this restaurant again .
I was greatly disappointed given the 4 stars when we went there tonight for happy hour . The 4 items we ordered as recommended by our server were unimpressive .
Simply put . Terrible . 3 : 30PM 11 . 7 . 15 . . . . . . . Didn ' t like anything I sampled . Sorry .
Overpriced , no healthy side options , and meh , food . Skip it .
The southwest flatbread has a really bad sweet taste to it , otherwise it probably would have been alright . The chili soup wasn ' t hot . At least the apple was alright .
Really wanted to like this place , but our burger was VERY dry : ( On another note , Salad was good !
Clutter shop furniture on top of furniture . Picked up cushion lollipop stuck to it ! Sales help follows you . Annoying & not helpful .
Unfortunately it was a bad experience the clerk there was really rude and hated being bothered when one would ask her a question .
Ordered appetizers and drinks . App ' s were low quality and not worth finishing . Left for another nearby restaurant and managed to salvage the evening .
Waitress was not very nice , even slightly rude . Food presentation was awful , no seasoning and tasteless and portion sizes were just ok . Falafel was dry and tasted several days old . Never again .
It took more than 2 hours to get my food delivered to the Palazzo . The sour soup tasted very fishy and bland while the shrimp was burnt . I would not recommend this place .
Under noooooo circumstances should you stay here . This is a Le Meridien that feels almost as good as a Red Roof Inn . Ridiculous . Holes in sheets and towels . No housekeeping . Worst experience EVER
I normally write a long review . Today , I will keep it short . Worst chili ever . Heavy handed with the salt . Stay away from it !
For the price point , good food but disappointing portion sizes . Specialty tea selection was clearly stale ( dragonwell ) and past its " serve - by " date . Unlikely to return .
The air conditioning is off at this store , most be closing down soon like the rest of Sears . Horrible store , stay away .
Way overpriced . Good quality juices but nothing that makes me not want to get juices from Pressed Juicery for half the price .
Very average food for the price . I can get better sushi at Journey all you can eat restaurant .
Ran out of water . Ran out of the bottomless chips . Server never came back , bartender had to track her down so I could pay . Totally forgot about me . Won ' t be back .
Decent selection . Above average produce . Very long lines during rush hour
Hideous ! The best part was the 22oz Dos Equis . The plates were bigger than our heads and completely devoid of flavor . Definitely a no go ever again .
Still very slow service . And my omelet had a few stray mushrooms in it . If you have 90 minutes to kill over a meal then eat here .
Long lines and just one person check the people out . Be ready to wait 30 minutes on the line if you go there . I will never go there again .
do not live here ! ive been here 2 years - horrible horrible maintenance . look somewhere else . runnnnnn .
Waited five minutes for someone to come up to tell us they closed five minutes earlier . AFTER READING REVIEWS , I AM GLAD WE PASSED .
Tourist trap . My burrito bowl was a gross ground beef on top of crappy iceberg lettuce and other low quality ingredients .
While the sushi I had was great , I can ' t in good conscience recommend this place . They sell bluefin tuna which is highly endangered .
Beautiful showroom , very friendly receptionist , just don ' t bother Gavin the sales manager . His time is far more valuable than yours .
Arrived after theatre with live band playing . Dance beat music but no dance floor and too loud to possibly speak amongst our selves . Took our meal to go . Not that special .
Went through the drive thru last night , Freddie had the worst customer service , you work there because you chose too ! Quit if you can ' t work it ! Ever going there late anymore !
Reasonable selection but unbelievably poor service , particularly in shoes . Moved to Scottsdale four years ago , and have found the service at the Scottsdale Macys to be suprisingly poor every time we stop in .
In 3 words : Not worth it . The patties were store bought and the price , outlandish considering . Honestly , you may as well go across the street to the 5 Guys .
very small and you could tell a lot of the people there were under aged
$ 60 + arrangement looked absolutely nothing like what was ordered . Cheap supermarket bouquets look better . Recipient was disappointed as well .
Rude customer service ! ! ! Don ' t try to work with this company . They are a rip off ! ! They don ' t know what customer service means .
We normally go here for a quick happy hour . Today is was a SAD HOUR ! ! ! Service sucked and they ran out of the chicken wing special ! ! ! Lololol !
I ' m not sure how much cooking goes on there . My fajitas , all $ 22 worth , appeared to be warmed up from a vacuum sealed plastic bag . The picture is worth a 1000 words
Close at 9pm ! ! Beware of the " Fall " hours that started in August . They are closed at 9pm . Yelp and the window sign says 10pm . Fail
We drove 30 minutes to this store to get some hiking boots and arrived 15 minutes before closing only to find that the store closed early for no reason . Very disappointed . I would avoid this store .
This place is awful . Their lettuce for the salads is old and brown and their sandwiches taste stale . There are so many other options in the area . Any of them are better than this place .
The one star is for the cofee . Didnt like their breakfast . I wven found an egg shell in my plate .
Not really anything to like about this restaurant . Awkwardly large with a bizarre menu and poor food quality .
Salsa was ok & the fish tacos . . . horrible . Tasted like the fish was bad . There is such a gr8 selection of Mexican restaurants , try a different one .
I got a salad and tomato basil soup . There were literally 2 croutons in my soup and the salad was basically lettuce and some sprinkled parmesan cheese .
Long waiting in line to be check in ( over one hrs , ) room on picture look nice but in reality not the same .
bad location . Dirty dishes . Poorly cooked food . Wouldn ' t recommend anyone to eat here , id choose iHOP down the street . And I hate IHOP lol .
I ' m not a meat person but they put almost NO meat on this bread sandwich . Why even bother when Subway is right down the street ?
I go here as a last resort . They ' re expensive and don ' t carry many common grocery items . I ' ll stick to frys and sprouts .
Would give zero stars if possible . Horrible customer service and mediocre results . If you have the opportunity to go somewhere else , do it .
I think USPS needs to be aware of the many ' claims ' customers are being requested to make . Mail fraud ? M
Steak house always impedes traffic on the left turn lane . They should sort out their loading zone .
The server tricked us getting Nachos making us think it was free . It turned out to be $ 8 . 5 + tax + tips , not cool ! !
Not clean . Don ' t go . I got an infection day after on my big toe . I saw the nail tech washing her own feet in one while I was drying my toes .
Service was terrible , was ignored 3 times by the waitress , food was ok , price was descent .
Hole in the wall with no selection and the staff is crabby to boot ! I try to avoid this location when possible .
Overpriced , over rated . The burger wasn ' t good , the fries were limp . I will never go back . In - n - out for me . . .
My dog eats better food than this crap . Glad I spent a ton on this awful lunch . Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else .
Unpleasant , rude customer service , drive - thru sucks , Long waiting time , not recommended location for people in rush .
This place is dirty and stuff is dirty . I recommend to everyone not to come here . I don ' t understand why is this place so full all the time food is bad .
The last three times we have gone there , the bagel selections were very limited . The primary business is bagels and coffee . Very disappointed each time ! ! This is at 10am !
Literally my sister and I have both bought food here that smelt / tasted like it came from gasoline I didn ' t know if I was gonna get food poisoning or not
This place isn ' t even open 24 / 7 went in and stood in line and these cleaners were cleaning the kitchen
I went there once , nothing special . I think Soup and Noodles across the street really kills their business .
Crap , just went today for lunch and ask for lamb biryani . They gave me bunch of rice and almost no meat . I had to throw it away and go somewhere else to eat .
* ordered a PLAIN burger * got a burger with onions and pickles instead Which part of the phrase " plain burger " is so hard to understand ? What a shame .
Extremely high turnover of employees . If you like you massage therapist , get their number as they ' ll be gone by your next appointment !
Meh . Food was good . Service was utterly confused . At first I thought it was because we were such a large group , but same issues as the other reviews .
Should be called crappys . So disappointed in food and its cost . The area and patio earned these 2 stars . .
Was there for lunch today . Floor service = clueless . Food service = really slow . Unfortunately I had to leave without having any food .
Popeyes is a classic . Delicious fried spicy goodness . But come on people . We all know why this place deserves a 2 star rating . We just know .
Not very good food , General Tao is hard , no actual chicken ; just batter , but is the only option in the area if looking for Asian ( Canadian ) inspired food .
We come here a few times a month . Service is always good and food is what you would expect . Tonite we placed our order and waited 63 minutes for our food . Absolutely rediculous .
Ate here for the first ( & last ) time . Bathroom was disgusting . Told the counter person , who went & looked , & returned w excuses for why it should look like that . YUK
Breakfast sandwiches are always sloppy and poorly made . I stopped going for quite a while hoping they would improve , but sadly they have not . And they have slow service .
called many times and left 2 vm never heard from them / her . weekdays or weekends wont return calls .
Bad service and waitresses unable to do math . Manager and owner unresponsive to all emails and complaints
Ate there once on a friends recommendation . The place was pretty expensive and just not very good . Generic food court food .
Don ' t use them , worst customer service ever . Came on time but the two workers would t open the door .
Disappointed with the crepe , there wasn ' t that much nuteLLa : ( Got the strawberry banana nuteLLa ! The matcha slush is good though , and the boba is aLways fresh .
Event coordinator was very snarky to wedding vendors working an event there .
DO NOT GO TO IDEAL IMAGE . I was severely burned ! I have permanent hypo and hyper - pigmentation ! My dermatologist said she has never seen such bad burns on such large areas !
Water flowing out of soft drink machine from back up of sewer line . You can smell it . This will be my last to me here . What has happened to McDonald ' s
Nice looking clean place inside . Food was not great . Taco shells were store bought . Tortillas didn ' t seem very fresh .
I ' m sorry to say but Bob Bradley passed away and this business is closed
Atmosphere is great , but the food is typical . The cost to quality is not good with regards to the food , however the beers are great .
This car wash need some serious service several bays out of order lost two dollars and two different vacuums very disappointing . No attendant on duty of course
No Frills brand Chicken Nuggets passed off as " boneless wings " are you kidding me ? The pizza itself was fine but the nuggets and my half full box of wedges made this a terrible experience .
The rooms are run down and are in need of remodeling . We were treated very poorly by the Shuttle driver . Both ways on a function we were promised a ride to .
I really don ' t like this place . I had a burger with way too much fancy stuff . I think I had an onion focacia bun and it just sucked . Overpriced and not good .
Not good at all ! ! ! ! Very , very overpriced , do yourself a favor and go to waffle house
How our pizza came from delivery $ 22 order to have it delivered looking like it fell on the floor board
burrito here is the worst i have had . . . small and a little pricey . coming from california , im use to real impressive burrito = (
The guy working behind the counter was eating his own ice cream . Hasn ' t cleaned the tables and floors . Super dirty !
Come on . . . it ' s Scottsdale can you at least have real cranberry juice ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? For my cocktail ? ? ? I would certainly pay a little extra
I have had several mishaps with mail recently ! Apparently other neighbors have had same problem ! Please try to improve your service
They were out of burgers . Half their beer selection was out . The staff was standing near the door smoking . 1st and last visit . Appears to be going under .
Paid over $ 9 for a 12oz very bland matcha latte . Didn ' t even finish it . The cup was half filled with ice to boot . I make better Matcha at home .
Poor customer service . Do not hold to their quote . Techs who come out don ' t know pricing , neither does the office person answering the phone .
Rude , inconsiderate owners who have no business dealing with the public .
If you enjoy being ignored by the bar tender and " accidentally " charged full price for the special over and over , then this bar is for you !
Worst customer service reps I have ever dealt with . They ' re rude on the phone and on site . About to terminate my membership with them .
The worst customer service . Very impolite . Nobody in this restaurant do not know about customer right .
The ER was completely empty , but I still ended up waiting forever . Plus they billed me 3 separate times , which was very shady . I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before I went .
People here are rude and pizza sucks don ' t go . They don ' t care about customers . Vistancia better without them .
horrible horrible horrible staff us rude food is terrible n drinks are watered down do not go ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Pizza hardly had any cheese , thanks a lot Miranda . The one on Apache is better than this
Amazing food but the take out service is horrible . . . They struggle with orders to go .
There ' s a reason why they have an F rating through the Better Business Bureau . Many negative complaints and one more just added from me
Everything was good til I hurt my tooth biting into a bone that they left in the salmon ! ! I ' m pissed
Giving 2 stars because we are unable to order online . We are 3 . 8 miles and unable to order online . This has caused us to order from Pizza Hut more often .
the food was okay , nothing special and way to overpriced for what it was , only 1 vegetarian option and it didn ' t look to good waitress was very friendly and gave great service
I went for the poutine ( fried , gravy and cheese curds ) but was disappointed . Prices were also on the high side in my opinion .
These guys call themselves a " Southwest " grill yet pulled all their stores out of AZ .
My original review was placed under this theater instead of the new one on Providence Boulevard . I ' ve only stopped by here accidentally when my friend looked up the wrong theater .
Horrible customer service they take there time to even take your order or even get your food out to you drive thru is horrible slow and usually missing parts of your order
Please let sales girls give good customer service . They didn ' t buy it . Deceitful practice is , so outdated . NORDSTROM is customers service , experts . Honesty is always going tocsell .
Security is a joke here and the ride was a horror show if i could put 0 stars i would .
For almost $ 7 the sub was equivalent in size to two Arby ' s sliders and comprised of unchewable corned beef grizzle . The most underwhelming sandwich experience of my life .
I used to eat here all the time but now it has age limit to 21 and over . So i won ' t be coming here no more with my familt .
Worst ever sushi place in Las Vegas and I been to a lot of them . Will never come back to this place ever . Food and service sucks b . . . . ls .
Ordered 4 sandwiches and all were wrong . Every sandwich had pesto and mayo on them . Don ' t waste your time if you want a breakfast sandwich .
Ordered via foodora portions were way too small , ordered brisket cornbread and butter square . Didn ' t get it . Made a claim . Could do alot better for the prices being charged here .
This was my first try of Mediterranean food and wasn ' t impressed . Food seemed old and dry . Maybe because i went near closing time .
Did not like , Know flavor to me on their food , clean inside restaurant , lots of workers
Not sure what reservations are for . Still have to wait to pickup a purchase should be 5 minute s max .
Food is overrated and servers are right out of an old Robert palmer video . Very nice but robotic
It ' s really appetizing to listen to the chef hack lung butter as he is preparing your food .
I had Chicken & Portobello and probably the worst chicken ever . The pasta with chicken was below average . This was our second time at Via Cibo in 3 years and never coming back again .
