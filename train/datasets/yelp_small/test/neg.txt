" The food was good , a bit pricy and the place is super busy at lunch time . They forgot our rolls & strawberries . "
quite authentic Japanese izaka - ya . Although each dish contains small portion of food , it tastes quite good .
What more can u say , it ' s a pharmacy . Doesn ' t stay open 24 tho . . . . .
I ordered the one thing on the menu specifically designed to induce immediate diarrhea , The Ranchero . Two bites in and I could already feel the squirtles .
Service very slow . Fish Fry tasted like and oven baked fried fish commercial brand . Perrogi ' s were excellent ! ! Friday Fish Fry
I was Craving pizza and this place definitely satisfied that . 1st pizza place I ' ve had since I moved from up North . So far so good .
The best sourdough sandwiches in Las Vegas . Fresh warm sourdough bread and fresh cut meats really make this place unique .
french toast was good and the scramble was good but overall it was good but nothing to tweet about , wait staff was friendly but get here early it gets packed
Stayed here several times and enjoyed it . Would definitely go back . Nice accommodations . Access to good food . Loved their buffet and consider it one of my favorites in Vegas !
The rudest staff ever . You should really consider letting customers tips so maybe they would be nice . They don ' t care about making customers happy at all . But the food is good
Good food for a hotel restaurant . Service is a bit slow so expect to spend a while . But every single server was super nice and accommodating . Friendly , Fresh and Convenient for the resort guests !
Food was good . Not great , we will not crave it or probably go back . But it was good . The service was not very good . It hurt to leave 20 % honestly .
Very friendly staff . Fish " tacos " are good although served tostada style , open faced ? Cute and fun atmosphere
Don ' t feel like cooking ? Well , come here and problem is solved ! Cheap and edible
A traditional grocery store with average prices , however I did like how they occasionally have sales on salad dressing and snapple juices . + their salads are surprisingly fresh
Nice theater . Parking is kinda difficult on weekends . No big complaints . Bathrooms are kept clean . I come here 2 Sundays a month .
It ' s a great downtown staple . Food and drinks are consistently well done . Menus changes with enough frequency to keep it interesting . Atmosphere is nice . Doesn ' t feel like a hotel resturant .
It was 110 degrees outside . Inside the IMAX luxury loungers felt like 55 degrees . It was cold . lol
Average mall with mcdonals , fitness center chinese resturant pizza pizza . Metro Price chopper etc . Nothing fansy
The kiwi juice was over - sweetened , and it didn ' t really taste like kiwi at all .
What can I say ? I try to avoid eating here , but I am a sucker for their Caramel mocha coffee and an occasional breakfast item . I suggest you try the mocha !
The Kobe Beef Sliders were really good . The service was very slow and there weren ' t even that many people in the restaurant at 2am . We were in there for almost over an hour !
Tres grand resto ideal pour organiser une soirée en grouoe . Les assiettes de pasta ordinaire mais l ' entrée pieuvre tres bonne . Belle deco rustique .
Good Place to come once to check out the pictures on the wall . Lots of history on those walls . Just like the rest of downtown , cheap beer and cheap gambling .
过了University后的Queen ST W又是一个购物区，系Queen S后面的Richmond ST & John St交界有间IMAX电影院，Marshalls隐藏在电影院隔离，进店后的Marshalls地方挺大，还有2楼，扶手电梯上落。2楼是男装，内衣类和家品区。地下一楼是时装，鞋类，手袋和护肤美体类。没有近college的marshalls甘高人气
The foods are okay . Slow service . We went here when they were not Busy . We only ordered 3 things plus drinks and only 2 came out .
Good beer selection and great additional space when the deck is open . Typical dive and bar food . Crowded on Friday / Saturday nights .
Great , if you like Denny ' s . The pie is the star attraction , lots of selections , food . . . , average
Service was mediocre . Selection is really small during the morning hours . So many delicious pastries only available after 3pm . . disappointing . . . Lox toast on brioche over salted .
Burgers average tasting . . . did not taste like high end beef . French fries barely warm . Service prompt and friendly .
Nice variety of selections . Decent prices . Always a good portion . Ingredients could be higher quality .
Loved the beef tataki , tempura , and chicken karaage . Its a small place that looks to be family run .
Im crazy for a sonoran dog , these are pretty tasty . Nice big place with plenty of seating .
Go here for the drinks and the atmosphere and you wont be disappointed . Dont prder the fish tacos .
Great breakfast . Fast server . Coffee cup was never empty . Good place for breakfast .
The food is good but a little pricey not enough food always leave hungry there should be refill on the drinks I usually order 5 tacos not very fill maybe it should be 6 tacos more variety .
Is a family restauran nothing exaiting the place is ok but she burn my Padd see u every time and i stop eating there
Great atmosphere but I found that the coffee was cold when I ordered it . Staff looked tired and not upbeat . Maybe just the time I came I suppose . Busy spot
Service is not that good . Food is very tasty and healthy and served quick . Unique sides too . Very reasonably priced as well . Recommend this place just don ' t expect good service .
Same old gym concept . Lock you in despite if you go or not . Makes money selling accounts to collection agencies . Nothing special . Personal trainers are hired third party . Clean facility . Friendly people .
Not sure what the hype is all about . Just an average burger and fries and a bit overpriced in my opinion .
5 stars for price . 3 stars for cleanliness 1 star for layout . . . odd aisles , difficult to navigate . . . feels overwhelming . I keep going if that says anything . : )
Burgers were weak Fries were really good Wings were amazing Service was a bit slow , but not a deal breaker
This cafe is convenient , the food is decent . Hardly any vegetarian options . Employees do not seem to understand what vegetarian means .
Decent beer selection and so - so food but seems to attract a very sketchy clientele . I ' d much rather stick to the tried and true establishments on 17th Ave .
Hope this place last but the manager lady is not very nice . Customer service is super important and when the manager at even have great service you got a problem
too expensive and the portions are too small food was good though
Basic Hotel and casino . Room was clean and nice , everyone friendly . Was there for a softball tournament and they ad great rates .
Not sure what to put I ' m confused maybe It ' s because it ' s first week . Got the Cajun hopefully it taste Cajun and hickory smoke I hope it cracks
Location is cute , decor reminds me of Mexico . They had a large selection of tequila . Only had appetizers but they were delicious . Hit the spot .
nice for breakfast and informal dinners in my neighbourhood
Typical diner food . Cute setup . The atmosphere is nice . Fast . If you ' re looking for a quick , hearty meal , stop here . However , it ' s not fancy .
Love the sweet potato fries but the rocket burger was meh . My wife ' s bacon burger tasted a lot better than the one I got .
I was expecting something really amazing as Cowboy Ciao is highly touted . While the salads are quite tasty , the wagyu burger and the Korean ribs I had other times were just average especially for the price .
Food is meh , especially compared to stars like Culinary Dropout ( this may be the weak link the Fox chain ) . Plentiful outdoor seating is nice , but this meal left something to be desired .
consistant service . No bells or whistles to keep me from going out of my way to get to this location .
Giving 3 stars bc the quality of fish has gone down . Ive been coming here for over 10 yrs and you can taste the difference in the freshness .
This will fix a burger craving . Big plus , fries are fresh cut .
Really pricey for my fiance and I the bill was a little over $ 60 for the all you can eat . You only get 2 rounds of all you can eat .
Against the self checkouts , refuse to use . Less workers means less jobs , same prices . Next they will have customers stocking shelves .
Walmart tire center helped me out with a car battery . The service was fast , friendly and affordable ! Leslie was extremely helpful ! Thank you !
Not the worse experience in buying a car but not anywhere the best . Had to wait forever for finance and then even longer for delivery .
Hit or miss . . . Sometimes it ' s the best chicken you ' ve ever tasted . Sometimes the chicken is raw and they refuse to refund you . There is zero consistency or happy medium .
Decent theatre , showing its age , although they do try to keep it up . Nice for a quick trip to the movies or for avoiding crowds at the more popular theatres .
This place has the best Steak breakfast for under 5 bucks in town workers are not always nice or on point but for the price you got to love it
2 pages of menu . Over 24 pages of wine listing . Not much diversity to the food items . The food was okay . nothing amazing . Kind of disappointing .
Slightly disappointing . . . definitely a lower quality restaurant with average at best food .
Wasn ' t good wasn ' t bad flounder was kinda mushy . Stuffing was bland . Service is great hush puppies are nice and salad was great
Expectations were high and not met . I went on a weekday morning and the food seemed day - old and the servers neglected me a bit . Still worth a quick stop though .
Yep it ' s a chain , like all other chains . Food is pretty good and cheap , fries are the best , soft chicken tacos on corn tortillas yummm !
Really good eggrolls . pho sucks ! Not hot enough it came out warm and not enough flavor . I will only come back for the eggrolls .
This location has had a couple of different named Japanese restaurants . The current iteration is decent but basically average , nothing remarkable . The Chef is Japanese American , decent skills but pretty quiet .
The custard tart is good but the service is really bad . They didn ' t give a shit at all .
can i transfer my credits from Rio Salado to Mesa college , or i have to drop out , i have taken two courses plz some one answer me
This past Thanksgiving break I was thinking to myself I wish grocery stores had Black Friday discounts . Next I walk into Myers and what why find , some staple items have been discounted for the day !
The fish stew was , for lack of a better word , awful . However , the service was excellent and the onion strings fabulous .
Three stars . One star for my moms salad being descent , 2nd star , sisters meatloaf not too shabby and 3rd star , for my bacon n mash potatoes . Hash browns OLD N OILY ! !
With so many killer options in the valley for Mexican food , this place is good . It won ' t blow your mind , but its good .
Tres satisfaite du steak burger , savoureux et copieux . La decoration oldy , bcp de banquettes et service relativement rapide pour l ' heure de pointe .
Fair . Seafood section smells and the floors are usually dirty . Prices are high . they need to do a competivie price check . Ads are weak .
I have been a few times and I really just don ' t get the hype . I really like Joe ' s Farmhouse Grill though ! ! !
Food was ok . Nothing spectacular . The service was definitely 5 star . Their pastries are a must try .
The food is okay , I feel it ' s a little overpriced and service is slow ! It ' s not a memorable place !
Cute place located in Planet Hollywood . Great raspberry sorbet gelato and slushy vodka drinks .
Ok food , airport prices , pretty quick service .
This place is ok . It ' s nested in J - town but pasta wise i don ' t taste much fusion in it and service was not that great the day I went .
Grabbed the Chicken Tikka Masala . Pretty average in my estimation . Naan was probably the highlight . Odd though ; they sold pizza at the counter .
Nice place to have a drink and some desent food . Chile relleno was good , but I ' m still looking for the fish in my fish tacos though
Bagels were good & it was conveniently close to work to get the dozen bucket for the shop . The manager here was a little on the rude side though must not be a morning person ! : D
Good food , nice atmosphere . Found the price a little high . Would have liked my fries to be included in the meal . . .
We used to like coming here , but it seems like the milkshakes keep getting worse . Too much milk .
Do not forget to check your change . . . for the third time they made a mistake . . . always on their side .
I usually come here to buy video controls or accessories . They lack in having rare video games , but they have a lot of the basic Nintendo games
Good steak . Ran of wagu steak on Tuesday nite . Came medium when ordered medium rare . Decent , but 3 stars at most .
Food is pretty good , service is not that great . Staff does not greet you once you enter .
Usual chili ' s . Not much to report . Service was a touch slow . Hadn ' t been to a chili ' s in a couple years . Not much of a change in the menu .
Stayed here for 1 night only . IMO , the rooms are a - ok for the price . I wouldn ' t mind staying here again . I wish the bathroom were bigger though .
Sat at the bar for ten mins . Bunch of employees standing around didn ' t bother to take our order or bring us water . . . we left & we won ' t be coming back !
Way too spicy . . . Could cut down on the spice level . Kids loved the mini idlis . .
The atmosphere is beautiful but the food is okay after eating there several times on several occasions .
I really don ' t get the hype . Jojo ' s is way better , as is Pamela ' s .
Great atmosphere . The pretzels are a great appetizer . We always get both cheese dips that go with the pretzels . The octoberfest beer is a traditional beer and not fall tasting like you would think .
I ' ve ate here once and i thought the food was pretty good . i really liked the fact they had multiple vegetarian options and was a big fan of the lentil and corn beignets .
Decent hotel , room was clean and well lit . Bathroom was a good size . No suite shop and the fitness center was a joke with only three peices of equipement and no weights .
The boba balls were not very fresh and the tea did not have the same flavore that I ordered the mango tasted like Jasmine tea .
Nice ambience , great selection of beer ofc , but small portions , overpriced and parkings a pain . I really enjoyed their Stuffed Chicken although , I would probably not go back just for that .
I ' ve only had the Philly cheesesteaks and I honestly loved it . I just tryed four fathers and it was better but this is still good !
Buy one dozen get one for a $ 1 , everyone and some came out , line is ridiculous long , just shows you people loves a great deal and some great doughnuts
Burger was ok . But the prices were a little high for a burger . Very cool atmosphere though . Probably won ' t go back . But worth a try .
They raised their prices to $ 25 . Lots of talking in their native language . There were three of us . Mine was good . We tipped $ 10 each and not even a thank you .
Tried to get an appointment 330 or later and appointments end at 330 ? A little bummed couldn ' t get in but now I get to try a new place . !
I always enjoy Beach Pizza . The crust is good and the sauce is tangy . I like that I am able to buy pizza by the slice at a reasonable price .
