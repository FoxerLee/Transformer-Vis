Great burgers ! Expensive but probably worth it , and thats not something id normally say about a $ 15 burger with fries .
Great chips and salsa , delicious generous portions , and very nice staff .
Great location ! Nice patio ! Coffee excellent ! I love the salads ! Great service they bring your food & drinks to the table & they check back on you !
Can ' t go wrong with the Lunch Special . Chicken Noodles and Thai fried rice are favorites .
The Killer Tomato Sandwich is to die for ! Enough said . It ' s cream cheese heaven ( with tomatoes ) . The waiter was really nice too ! : ) I would definitely come back .
I got the turkey burger with avocado and onion rings . Not bad ! Hard to find a good turkey burger at a fast food place .
I have been buying this food since they open . They have a good menu and is very traditional Caribbean Food . They always treat you with respect .
i would ' ev gave this place a 5 but you have to pay for wi - fi ( as usual with any high class hotel )
The Salmon tempura was really good , the veggie sushi was a disappointment . The place itself is really nice . .
Best Ballgame Walk across The river is A fantastic Pittsburgh experience .
The food was really good , if you like Daphne ' s chain restaurants you ' ll love this even more .
Excellent service . . . very clean facility . Terri does an excellent job . . no need to drive far away to get your haircut if you live in the area .
Started going here recently and had a great experience every time . All the barbers do a fantastic job and advise you on the best cut .
Food is good , but overpriced for what you get . It ' s basically an outside cafeteria . . . which is okay if you ' re aren ' t paying top prices .
Really good taco spot but not quite 5 stars . Everything was good but not amazing . Loved the spicy cucumber margarita and the staff was great too .
Pho Tai Nam is my usual order . The broth is great . The food is amazing and the atmosphere is chill . Be sure to try the belly , crispy egg rolls , and the pepper wings !
Great place to visit before a show or just meet up with friends . Great service and very friendly staff . The food is fresh and very tastey . I look forward to visiting again .
Must try the egg drop soup with tofu , vegetables and citrus . Good food at a great price . The chicken and Broccoli is also very good .
Great food , good value , huge sides and it was really nice to be casual in a steak house . We will be there a lot .
Neat place . The burgers were great although very big . Fries were very good . Try them with the spicy aioli . Fried sour dough balls were yum . Good service .
Great place to get breakfast . I ' ve stopped in twice now & still great service . Tried the strawberry Belgian waffle & eggs benedict . Price is average ( $ 25 for the two items )
Hot dogs are so freaking delicious but not five stars cause the little cart by the casino sells them for 4 dollars instead smh
Love their meat platters . A better variety than other Italian restaurants I ' ve been to . Their pastas are also delicious and flavourful .
We love this place . The staff is usually very friendly and helpful and the sushi is always good . I recommend the " las vegas roll " ! ! !
Chicken pot pie was great . Service was a little slow but I ' d definitely go back !
Exceptional service and food , this is our favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto . It ' s a hidden gem
Charcuterie plate needs a bit more for the price and the old fashioned was a bit sweet for my liking . Otherwise the house made chorizo was good and the pork shoulder was cooked perfectly tender .
Line ups are expected but worth the wait . Food is always good - Always ! I have never had an experience of the Sashimi being off .
Black bean fritters rock and they have a couple good vegetarian options . They are always accommodating and make a good mojito . Oh and when they have the pumpkin bisque . . . oh lord !
Very interesting concept ! Pleasantly surprised . Friendly staff , nice atmosphere ! Its pretty cool Matthews is brining in cool , trendy spots like this .
位于kensington Market内，门面看落去好旧好普通甘，进店后发觉地方都几大，除了新鲜蔬菜水果外，还售卖芝士类、豆类果仁和其他副食产品，还有少许零食等。环境比较暗，摆设简单。但因为产品质素不错，还是有不少本地西人过来选购。
Very tasteful sushi and liked the two combination dishes . Ordered grilled teriyaki chicken and spicy tuna sushi . The highlight was the sake bomber ! !
Great pizza , solid price . The topping were great and fresh , the crust was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside . Definitely hit the spot !
Great food . Good beer and great service . Lamb tacos really good . Going back for dinner .
