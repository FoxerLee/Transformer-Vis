Really bad customer service , the lady at the phone was super rude when I was trying to order a delivery . So rude that she hang up on me
Disappointing recently as i use to go all the time but now buttered chicken was watery
Food was ok nothing to write home about . Service super slow . 1 person for a 45 plus seat restaurant is crazy ! Don ' t think I would come back ! 44 $ and still hungry .
Not a fan at all ! . Tastes like McDonald ' s to be honest ! . Burger was cold and no flavor at all .
Not impressed . Service was slow . Price was too high for the small portion . Savory choices would be welcome .
Went and bought a comforter set it was used and dirty and filthy on the inside the pillows were stained and they hid it by turning them inside so you couldn ' t see from the outside
Read good reviews and was so disappointed . Went there for lunch . Service was slow ( there were only a few people there ) and the food was terrible ( not cooked well and no flavor ) .
Be aware of the fact that they rent dry and you need to wait until Landmark gets around to fueling your aircraft after you return . I waited over 45 minutes to finally settle my bill ! !
We ordered two milkshakes and it took over 20 minutes . Service was not good . First and only time coming here
Worst McDonald ' s ever . 2 people ordering but 30 people waiting . Wrong orders . It ' s actually hillarious anyone can run something this bad
Had the special at 3 pm if it matters . Mediocre marinara and odd tasting meatballs . The ambiance is great but the quality of food as a franchise would . Not memorable at all
Way over priced . Had a bunch of weird Shiet on the menu . Tries way too hard to be hip . Extremely overpriced . But . . . . The wings were good .
Terrible service lied to me about the price over the phone very rude and unprofessional and also refused to accept my coupon that I had .
The subs are just okay : ( but way to expensive for what you get . There are many other sub places to choose from in the area that are much better unfortunately .
This place sucks . Worst tropical smoothie ever . I won ' t be returning to this location ever again .
The ice cream was not fresh and did not have a good texture .
I remember when this place opened years ago and it was great . All it is now is a place for vagrants and garbage to hang around .
Came all the way here to get their pork bone soup . 3hours before they close they said they dont have enough to make one order .
