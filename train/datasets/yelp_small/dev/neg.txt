Good food ( butter chicken was awesome ) and great service . . . . but the interior could use some improvement .
The meat was tasty but overall an average Korean BBQ joint . Didn ' t refill our side dishes .
It was okay , I ' ve had better . It didn ' t seem very fresh and it was pretty skimpy in the meat portions .
The food was ay okay . It was not hot just warm The tables were way too small for our party of four Yet the service was amazing
Not bad . Got meat magnificent and habenero wings . Enjoyed both of them . Also I was on travel so delivery was convenient . Solid meal .
This pizza walks a thin line between A - OK and drunken munchies .
Went to Chicago concert last night . Parking both getting in and out was fine . food and drink prices are on the high side for what you get . security is overboard , lines moved slowly .
They have been reopened for a year or more . Average food at a cheap price . Not bad if you are hungry and lazy like i sometimes am .
Average food for the price . Nice place and they were understaffed but we ordered what was recommended and weren ' t impressed . . . .
Coffee wise . Ok . Probably better if I had a fancy drink . Def not worth the wait for just coffee
I love their chicken wraps and the home made pub chips ! They are SOOO good ! I haven ' t tried anything else yet but I will be coming back
Reliable , fresh and tasy . The corn bread muffins on the salad bar are a treat .
Great atmosphere , food was excellent . My only issue is there isn ' t one person of color on the waitstaff .
